## 1. Instagram / Facebook Post (Mr. George — Home Health Expert)

**Caption:**

March is here, and your pool is about to work overtime. ☀️

Before the heat really kicks in, here are 3 things every Florida pool owner should do this month:

1. Check your filter pressure gauge. If it's 8-10 PSI above the clean baseline, it's time for a deep clean or replacement.

2. Test your water chemistry weekly, not monthly. Warmer temps mean algae moves fast. Keep your free chlorine between 1-3 ppm and pH between 7.2-7.6.

3. Inspect your pool deck for cracks. Florida's wet/dry cycles cause concrete to shift. Small cracks now become trip hazards by summer.

Your pool is one of the biggest investments in your home. A little attention now saves a lot of headaches in July.

## 2. TikTok Script (30-45 sec)

**HOOK (0-5 sec):**
"Your pool is about to turn green and you don't even know it yet."

**VALUE (5-35 sec):**
"March in Florida means the temperature is climbing fast, and algae doesn't wait for an invitation. Here's what most pool owners miss:

Your filter has a pressure gauge. When it reads 8 to 10 PSI above your clean baseline, your filter is choking. It's not cleaning anything.

Second, stop testing your water once a month. In Florida heat, chemistry shifts in days. Weekly testing, minimum.

And third — check your pool deck for cracks before someone rolls an ankle at your next cookout."

**Comment:**

Hey! A few things that might help — when your filter pressure gauge reads 8-10 PSI above the clean starting point, it's definitely time for a clean or swap. Also, in Florida especially March through October, weekly water testing makes a huge difference. Free chlorine should stay between 1-3 ppm. If the water is already green, you're looking at a shock treatment (3-5x normal chlorine dose), run the pump 24 hours, then brush and vacuum once it clears. Hope that helps!
