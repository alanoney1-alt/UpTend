**Topic:** Garage Door Maintenance

## 1. Instagram / Facebook Post

**Caption:**

Your garage door is the largest moving part of your home — and most people never maintain it. 🏠

Here are 5 things to check this weekend:

🔧 Lubricate the rollers, hinges, and tracks with white lithium grease (NOT WD-40)
👁️ Inspect the weatherstripping along the bottom — cracked = energy loss + pests
⚖️ Test the balance: disconnect the opener and lift halfway. It should stay put. If it falls, the springs need adjusting.
🔄 Check the auto-reverse safety: place a 2x4 under the door and close it. It MUST reverse.
👂 Listen for grinding or scraping — that's metal-on-metal wear before something breaks.

A well-maintained garage door lasts 20-30 years. A neglected one? You'll know when the spring snaps at 6 AM on a Monday.

Stay ahead of it. 💪

## 2. TikTok Script (45 sec)

**HOOK (0-5s):**
"Your garage door weighs 400 pounds and it's held up by TWO springs. When's the last time you checked them?"

**VALUE (5-35s):**
"Here's your Friday garage door check — takes 5 minutes.

First — disconnect the opener and lift the door halfway. Let go. If it drops, your springs are off balance. Do NOT touch those springs yourself — they're under insane tension.

Second — grab some white lithium grease and hit the rollers, hinges, and tracks. NOT WD-40. WD-40 is a degreaser, not a lubricant.

Third — put a 2x4 on the ground and close the door on it. If it doesn't reverse immediately, your safety sensor is off. Fix that before someone gets hurt."

**CTA (35-45s):**
"Save this for the weekend. Your garage door does 1,500 cycles a year — give it 5 minutes. Follow for more home tips that actually matter."

**For posts like:** "My garage door is making a loud grinding noise" / "Garage door won't open" / "Spring broke on my garage door"

**Response:**

That grinding usually means the rollers or hinges need lubrication — white lithium grease works great (avoid WD-40, it actually strips lubricant over time). If the door is struggling to open or feels heavy when you lift it manually, the spring tension is probably off.

⚠️ One thing — never try to adjust or replace garage door springs yourself. They're under extreme tension and it's one of the most dangerous DIY repairs out there. That's a job for a pro with the right tools.

For the noise specifically: check if the track is bent or if a roller has gone flat. Sometimes it's just a $5 nylon roller replacement.
