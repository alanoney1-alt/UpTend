**Topic:** Mold Prevention in Florida Homes

**Caption:**

🏠 Florida homeowners — mold doesn't wait for summer.

Right now, as we move from cooler nights into warmer days, the temperature swings create condensation in places you can't see. Behind walls. Under sinks. Inside closets against exterior walls.

Here are 3 things you can do THIS WEEK:

1️⃣ Check under every sink for slow drips — even a tiny leak feeds mold in 24-48 hours
2️⃣ Run your bathroom exhaust fan for 15 minutes AFTER every shower, not just during
3️⃣ Keep indoor humidity below 60% — a $12 hygrometer from any hardware store tells you where you stand

Mold doesn't announce itself. By the time you smell it, it's already established.

Stay ahead of it. Your home will thank you. 🫡

## 2. TikTok Script (45 sec)

**HOOK (0-5s):**
"If you live in Florida and you DON'T do this… you're growing mold right now."

**VALUE (5-35s):**
"Here's what most people get wrong. They think mold is a summer problem. Nope. February and March in Florida? That's when cool nights meet warm afternoons, and condensation builds up in your walls, your closets, under your sinks.

Three things. Do them today.

One — check under every single sink. A tiny drip you ignore becomes a mold colony in two days.

Two — your bathroom fan? Run it fifteen minutes AFTER you shower. Not during. After. That's when the moisture settles.

Three — grab a hygrometer. Twelve bucks. If your humidity is over sixty percent indoors, you've got a problem brewing."

**CTA (35-45s):**
"Save this for someone who just moved to Florida. They need it. Follow for more home health tips every week."

**Format notes:** Face-to-camera, casual but authoritative. No branding.

## 3. Facebook Group Comment Template (Lake Nona / Orlando Groups)

**For posts like:** "Just noticed dark spots on my bathroom ceiling" / "Is this mold?" / "Mold remediation recommendations?"

**Comment:**

> Before you call anyone — check your bathroom exhaust fan. Flip it on and hold a tissue near it. If the tissue doesn't stick, the fan isn't pulling air and that's likely your root cause.
>
> For the spots you already see: a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle works for surface mold on non-porous surfaces (tile, painted drywall). Spray, let it sit 10 min, wipe.
>
> If the area is larger than about 3 feet by 3 feet, or if you see it coming through from behind the drywall, that's when you want a pro — specifically someone with mold remediation certification, not just a general handyman.
>
> Also check your indoor humidity with a cheap hygrometer. Florida homes should stay under 60%. If you're above that consistently, a dehumidifier is your best friend.
