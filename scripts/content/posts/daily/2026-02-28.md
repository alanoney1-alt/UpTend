## 1. Instagram / Facebook Post (Mr. George -- Home Health Expert)

**Caption:**

Saturday is the perfect day to give your driveway some attention.

Here's what most people get wrong about pressure washing:

1. They use too much pressure on concrete. 3,000 PSI is plenty for most residential driveways. Go higher and you'll etch the surface.

2. They skip the pre-treatment. A degreaser applied 10 minutes before washing cuts your time in half and actually removes stains instead of just pushing them around.

3. They hold the nozzle too close. Keep 6-8 inches of distance. Closer doesn't mean cleaner -- it means damage.

4. They forget to seal after. Pressure washing opens the pores of concrete. If you don't seal within 48 hours, you're inviting new stains right back in.

Your driveway is the first thing people see. Treat it like it matters.

## 2. TikTok Script (30-45 sec)

**HOOK (0-3s):**
"Stop ruining your driveway every time you pressure wash it."

**VALUE (3-25s):**
"Three mistakes I see every single weekend.

Number one -- you're standing too close. Six to eight inches. That's it. Any closer and you're carving lines into your concrete.

Number two -- you're skipping degreaser. Spray it on, wait ten minutes, then wash. Otherwise you're just rearranging the dirt.

Number three -- you never seal after. Pressure washing opens the pores of concrete. If you don't seal within two days, new stains soak right in."

**CTA (25-30s):**
"Save this for your next Saturday project. Drop a comment if you've ever left lines in your driveway -- no judgment."

## 3. Facebook Group Comment Template (Lake Nona groups)

**For posts like:** "Anyone recommend a good pressure washing company?" / "How much should pressure washing cost?" / "Is it worth doing myself?"

**Response:**

For a standard 2-car driveway in Lake Nona, you're looking at $150-250 from most local companies. If you're doing it yourself, rent a 3,000 PSI machine from Home Depot (about $100/day) and grab a concrete degreaser. Apply the degreaser first, wait 10 minutes, then wash at 6-8 inches distance with a 25-degree nozzle. Don't forget to seal within 48 hours after or you'll be doing it again in 3 months instead of 6. The Florida sun and rain combo is brutal on unsealed concrete.
