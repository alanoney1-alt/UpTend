**Topic: Water Heater Maintenance**

## 1. Instagram/Facebook Post

**Caption:**

Your water heater works 365 days a year — but when's the last time you checked on it? 🤔

Here's what most homeowners miss:

🔧 Sediment builds up at the bottom of your tank every single month
💧 A simple 60-second flush twice a year can add 3-5 YEARS to its lifespan
🌡️ Your temperature should be set to 120°F — not higher
⚠️ That pressure relief valve? Test it yearly. It's a safety device, not decoration.

A water heater replacement runs $1,200-$3,000+. A little maintenance? Free.

Your home works hard for you. Return the favor. 🏠

**Suggested Image:** Clean, well-lit photo-style image of a residential water heater in a utility closet, with a subtle warm glow. Include a visual callout showing the drain valve at the bottom and the temperature dial set to 120°F. Professional, informative feel — not stock-photo generic.

## 2. TikTok Script (45 sec)

**HOOK (0-5s):**
"Your water heater is secretly dying right now. Here's how to save it in 60 seconds."

**VALUE (5-35s):**
"See that valve at the bottom? That's your drain valve. Twice a year, grab a bucket, attach a hose, and flush out the sediment that's been cooking in there.

While you're at it — check your temperature dial. If it's above 120 degrees, you're wasting money AND risking scalding.

Last thing — that little lever on the side? That's your pressure relief valve. Flip it once a year. If no water comes out, it's failed and you need a pro ASAP.

These three things take five minutes total."

**CTA (35-45s):**
"Follow for more home tips that actually save you money. Drop a 🔥 if your water heater is older than 8 years — you might be on borrowed time."

**For posts like:** "My water isn't getting as hot as it used to" / "How often should I maintain my water heater?" / "Is it worth replacing my water heater?"

**Template:**

Great question! A few things to check before calling anyone:

1. Look at the temperature dial on your unit — should be at 120°F
2. If the water's lukewarm, sediment buildup is usually the culprit. You can flush it yourself with a garden hose (YouTube has great walkthroughs)
3. Check the age — there's a serial number on the label that encodes the manufacture date. Most tank heaters last 8-12 years

If it's leaking from the bottom or the pressure relief valve is constantly dripping, that's when you want a pro out there sooner rather than later. Hope that helps! 🏠
