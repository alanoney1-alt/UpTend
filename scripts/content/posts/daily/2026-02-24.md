**Caption:**

Your dryer vent is one of the most overlooked fire hazards in your home. 🔥

Here's the truth: clogged dryer vents cause nearly 3,000 house fires every year in the U.S. — and most of them are 100% preventable.

**3 signs your dryer vent needs cleaning:**
🧺 Clothes take more than one cycle to dry
🔥 The dryer feels unusually hot to the touch
💨 You notice a musty smell on your clothes

Quick rule of thumb: if it's been more than 12 months since your last vent cleaning, you're overdue.

A clean vent also cuts your energy bill by up to 30%. Your wallet and your family will thank you. 💛

## 2. 🎬 TikTok Script (45 sec)

**HOOK (0-5s):**
"Your dryer is trying to tell you something and you're ignoring it."

**VALUE (5-40s):**
"If your clothes are taking forever to dry, your dryer is hot to the touch, or your laundry smells musty — your dryer vent is clogged. And I'm not just talking about the lint trap. I mean the actual vent that goes to the outside of your house. Most people never clean it. And that's a problem — because clogged dryer vents are one of the top causes of house fires in America. Nearly 3,000 a year. Here's what you do: pull your dryer out, disconnect the vent hose, and clean it out. Check the outside flap too — birds love nesting in those things."

**CTA (40-45s):**
"Save this for later and tag someone who does laundry every day. They need to see this."

**For:** "Anyone know someone who can clean dryer vents?" / "Who do you use for dryer vent cleaning?" / general handyman questions

**Response:**

Hey! Great question — this is one of those things that's super important but easy to forget about. A good dryer vent cleaning usually runs $100-150 depending on how long the vent run is and how long it's been. Make sure whoever you hire actually cleans the full duct to the outside, not just the lint trap area. If they don't check the exterior flap, that's a red flag. Also worth asking if they'll inspect for any kinks or damage in the ductwork while they're at it. Hope that helps! 👍
