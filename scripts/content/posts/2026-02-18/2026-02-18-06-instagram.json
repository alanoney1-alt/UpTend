When's the last time you cleaned yours?\n\n---\n\n✅ Good advice: disconnect the vent, use a dryer vent brush kit, clean both ends, check the exterior flap. Basic but important.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: the transition hose (that flexible piece behind the dryer) is where most lint builds up. And if you have a long vent run or multiple elbows, a brush kit won't cut it — you need a drill-powered rotary brush.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: After cleaning, run the dryer empty on high heat for 10 minutes. Feel the airflow at the exterior vent. If it's weak, there's still a blockage. Also — replace foil/vinyl transition hoses with rigid aluminum. They don't trap lint.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
