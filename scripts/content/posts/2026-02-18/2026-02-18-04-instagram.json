  "text": "⚡ Replacing a light switch is easier than you think. But skip one step and it gets dangerous fast.\n\n---\n\n✅ Good videos show: turn off the breaker, test with a voltage tester, match wires to the new switch. Solid basics.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: ALWAYS test BOTH sides of the switch with a non-contact voltage tester. Mislabeled breaker panels are way more common than you'd think. Also — backstab connections (push-in) loosen over time. Use the screw terminals.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Take a photo of the old wiring BEFORE you disconnect anything. Future you will thank present you. And wrap your connections with electrical tape over the wire nuts.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
