But install it wrong and you could fry your HVAC system.\n\n---\n\n✅ Most videos cover: turn off HVAC at breaker, label your wires, match to new thermostat terminals. Good foundation.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: the C-wire problem. Many older homes don't have a common wire, and your smart thermostat NEEDS power. Using the fan wire as a workaround can damage your system. Also — if you have a heat pump, the wiring is completely different from standard HVAC.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Before buying, pop off your current thermostat and count the wires. Take a photo. Most smart thermostat brands have a compatibility checker on their website. Five minutes of checking saves a $200 mistake.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
