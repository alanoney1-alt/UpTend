Let's fix it for $5.\n\n---\n\n✅ Standard advice works: replace the washer or cartridge, check the O-rings, make sure the seat isn't damaged. Covers most leaks.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: identifying your faucet type FIRST. Ball, cartridge, disc, or compression — each has different parts. Buying a \"universal repair kit\" wastes money. Also, if the valve seat is pitted, a new washer will leak again in weeks.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Take the old cartridge to the hardware store to match it exactly. Or snap a photo of the faucet brand/model (usually under the handle or on the base). Most manufacturers will send you parts for free under warranty.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
