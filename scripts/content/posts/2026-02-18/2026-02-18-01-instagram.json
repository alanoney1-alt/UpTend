  "text": "🚽 Your toilet is literally flushing money down the drain. A running toilet wastes up to 200 gallons a DAY. Let's fix that.\n\n---\n\n✅ Most DIY videos nail the basics: check the flapper, adjust the float, inspect the fill valve. These cover 90% of running toilets.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they skip: the flush valve seat. If it's corroded or has mineral buildup, a new flapper won't seal properly. Also — that hairline crack in the overflow tube? Yeah, that'll keep running forever.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Before replacing anything, put food coloring in the tank. Wait 15 min. If color appears in the bowl without flushing, it's definitely the flapper. Save yourself a trip to the hardware store.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
