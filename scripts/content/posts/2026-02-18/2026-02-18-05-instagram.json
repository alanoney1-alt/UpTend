Good news: you don't need a contractor for this one.\n\n---\n\n✅ Most tutorials cover it well: California patch method, mesh tape, joint compound, sand and paint. Classic.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: matching the existing texture. A smooth patch on an orange-peel wall screams \"I did this myself.\" Also, most people don't prime before painting — and the patch soaks up paint differently.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: For small holes, use a setting-type compound (the powder you mix) instead of pre-mixed. It doesn't shrink, so you need fewer coats. For texture matching, practice on cardboard first.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
