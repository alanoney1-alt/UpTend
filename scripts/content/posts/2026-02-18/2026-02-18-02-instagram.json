There's a better way, and it won't destroy your pipes.\n\n---\n\n✅ Good advice out there: try a plunger first, use a drain snake, and baking soda + vinegar can help with minor clogs.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: chemical drain cleaners eat through old pipes. And if you have a garbage disposal clog, snaking from the wrong end just pushes it deeper.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Wet/dry shop vac on the drain opening. Seal it tight. The suction pulls clogs out instead of pushing them in. Game changer.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
