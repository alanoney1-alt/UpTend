Here's what to do.\n\n---\n\n✅ Good videos show: hit the reset button underneath, use an Allen wrench in the bottom hole to manually turn the blades. Both solid first steps.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: if it's a grease clog (not a jam), the Allen wrench trick won't help. You need to disconnect the drain and clean the trap. Also — running hot water with grease actually makes it worse. Cold water solidifies grease so the disposal can chop it.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Ice cubes + salt + cold water. Run the disposal with a cup of ice and coarse salt. It scrubs the blades and walls clean. Do this monthly and you'll never have a smell problem.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
