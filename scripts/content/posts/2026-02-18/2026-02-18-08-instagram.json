Every video gets this right — because it really is that simple.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: flappers aren't universal! Kohler, American Standard, and Toto all use different sizes. A \"universal\" flapper from the hardware store might not seal properly. Also — clean the flush valve seat with a Scotch-Brite pad before installing.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Write your toilet brand and model inside the tank lid with a Sharpie. Next time you need parts, you'll know exactly what to buy without crawling behind the toilet.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY?
