  "text": "🚪 That squeaky door is driving everyone crazy. 30-second fix, zero tools needed.\n\n---\n\n✅ WD-40 on the hinge? Sure, it works... for about a week. Most videos show the spray-and-pray method.\n\n---\n\n⚠️ What they miss: WD-40 is a solvent, not a lubricant. It'll dry out and the squeak comes back. Also, if the hinge pin is bent or worn, no amount of lube fixes that.\n\n---\n\n💡 George's Pro Tip: Pull the hinge pin, coat it in white lithium grease or petroleum jelly, tap it back in. That's a permanent fix. Takes 2 minutes.\n\n---\n\n📱 Too big for DIY? George can book a pro in 60 seconds → uptendapp.com\n\nSave this for later — your home will thank you. 🏠",
