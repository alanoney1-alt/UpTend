# Home Services in Lake Nona: The Complete Guide for Homeowners

Lake Nona is one of the fastest-growing communities in Orlando, and for good reason. With master-planned neighborhoods like Laureate Park, Randal Park, and Eagle Creek, plus the booming Medical City corridor, it's become one of Central Florida's most desirable places to live. But keeping a home in top shape here requires more than just mowing the lawn once a week.

Whether you just closed on a new build or you've been in your Lake Nona home for years, this guide covers every home service you should know about — and the local quirks that make maintaining a home in Central Florida different from anywhere else.

## Essential Home Maintenance Services Every Lake Nona Homeowner Needs

Florida's combination of heat, humidity, and afternoon thunderstorms creates a unique set of challenges for homeowners. Here's what should be on every Lake Nona homeowner's radar:

**Pressure Washing** — Between the humidity and the daily summer rains, mold, mildew, and algae build up on driveways, sidewalks, pool decks, and home exteriors faster than you'd expect. Most Lake Nona HOAs require exterior surfaces to be kept clean, so plan on pressure washing your driveway and walkways at least twice a year. A full house wash once a year keeps things looking sharp and prevents long-term damage to stucco and paint.

**Gutter Cleaning** — With mature oaks and seasonal storms dropping debris year-round, clogged gutters are one of the leading causes of water damage in Orlando-area homes. The flat terrain in Lake Nona means drainage matters more, not less — standing water around your foundation is a recipe for problems. Clean your gutters at minimum twice a year: once before hurricane season (June) and once after the leaves drop in late fall.

**Pool Maintenance** — If you have a pool (and in Lake Nona, odds are you do), weekly maintenance is non-negotiable. Florida's warm temperatures accelerate algae growth and throw off chemical balance quickly. Beyond weekly cleaning, budget for quarterly filter deep-cleans and an annual equipment inspection. The phosphate levels in Lake Nona's water supply tend to run higher than other parts of Orlando, so keep an eye on that.

**Landscaping and Lawn Care** — St. Augustine grass is the standard in most Lake Nona yards, and it's beautiful when maintained but unforgiving when neglected. Weekly mowing during the growing season (March through October), regular fertilization following Orange County's fertilizer blackout dates, and proper irrigation scheduling will keep your lawn healthy. Most irrigation systems in newer Lake Nona communities use reclaimed water, which is great for conservation but can leave mineral deposits on hardscaping over time.

**HVAC Service** — Your AC is working overtime roughly nine months of the year in Central Florida. Schedule professional maintenance at least twice a year — once before summer kicks in and once mid-season. Change your filter monthly during peak cooling months. A well-maintained system lasts 15-20 years; a neglected one might give you 8-10.

## Seasonal Home Care Calendar for Central Florida

Timing matters in Florida. Here's a practical breakdown:

**Spring (March–May):** Schedule your annual termite inspection. This is the time to pressure wash the exterior, check weatherstripping on doors and windows, and service your AC before it starts running 18 hours a day. Get your irrigation system checked — sprinkler heads get damaged over winter by lawn crews and settling soil.

**Summer (June–September):** Hurricane prep is the headline item. Clean gutters, trim trees away from the house (especially anything near power lines or your roof), and verify your storm shutters or impact windows are in working order. This is also prime time for interior projects — painting, minor renovations, and organizing — since you'll be indoors during afternoon storms anyway.

**Fall (October–November):** Post-hurricane season checkup. Inspect your roof for any damage from summer storms. This is the best time for exterior painting in Central Florida — lower humidity and mild temperatures mean paint adheres better and dries properly. Schedule a second gutter cleaning.

**Winter (December–February):** Florida's "winter" is mild but it's your window for landscaping projects, tree planting, and outdoor hardscaping. The cooler, drier air is also perfect for attic insulation checks and sealing any gaps where pests might be sneaking in.

## How to Find Reliable Home Service Professionals in Lake Nona

Finding trustworthy help is the real challenge. Lake Nona's rapid growth means there's no shortage of companies advertising in the area, but quality varies wildly. Here's what to look for:

**Check for proper licensing and insurance.** Florida requires contractors to be licensed for many types of work. Ask for their license number and verify it on the DBPR (Department of Business and Professional Regulation) website. General handyman work doesn't require a state license in Florida, but any plumbing, electrical, or structural work does.

**Get multiple quotes, but don't just go with the cheapest.** Lowball bids in the home services industry usually mean corners will be cut, or you'll get hit with upcharges once the work starts. A detailed, written estimate with line items is a green flag. A vague verbal quote is a red flag.

**Ask your neighbors.** Lake Nona's neighborhood Facebook groups and Nextdoor communities are goldmines for recommendations. Laureate Park, Moss Park, and Eagle Creek all have active groups where homeowners share their experiences — good and bad. A referral from someone on your street is worth more than a hundred online reviews.

**Look for companies that serve multiple needs.** Dealing with six different vendors for six different services is a headache. Platforms and companies that can handle junk removal, pressure washing, gutter cleaning, landscaping, and handyman work under one roof save you time and usually offer better pricing on bundled services.

## What Lake Nona Homeowners Are Spending on Home Services

To set realistic expectations, here's what the Orlando metro market looks like for common services in 2026:

- **Pressure washing (driveway + house):** $250–$500
- **Gutter cleaning (single-story):** $125–$200
- **Lawn care (weekly mowing + edging):** $120–$180/month
- **Pool cleaning (weekly service):** $120–$200/month
- **Handyman (general repairs):** $65–$95/hour
- **Junk removal (single load):** $150–$400 depending on volume

These are averages for the Lake Nona area. Prices tend to be slightly higher than greater Orlando due to the drive distance from where many contractors are based (most home service companies operate out of the OBT corridor or Kissimmee area).

## Making Home Maintenance Less Overwhelming

The key to staying on top of home maintenance without it consuming your weekends is having a system. Whether that's a spreadsheet, a calendar reminder, or a dedicated app, the homeowners who stay ahead of problems are the ones who schedule preventive care rather than reacting to emergencies.
