### 1. AI Flesh Demon in Real Estate Listing (VIRAL NOW)
A realtor's AI-edited listing photo accidentally included a terrifying "flesh demon" — going mega-viral on Reddit/X/TikTok.

**Mr. George React Post (FB/IG):**
> "As your Home Health Expert, I need to address this 😂 AI is a powerful tool for home services — but maybe don't let it stage your listing photos unsupervised. That 'flesh demon' in the living room is NOT increasing your home value. Always have a real professional review before posting. Your home deserves better than AI hallucinations. 🏠👻"

**TikTok Script Idea:**
- Hook: "POV: You're house hunting and the AI staging added a DEMON" 
- Show the viral image, then Mr. George reacting
- Pivot to: "Here's what GOOD home tech looks like" → quick showcase of AI home scan
- Sound: Reality show editing trend (see below)

Stay smart about smart tech. 🔒🏠"

### 5. Pressure Washing Satisfying Content (Evergreen Trend)
- Multiple new YT videos trending: "Right way to clean concrete pavers" (ASMR style), "Years worth of grime" transformations
- Consumer Reports just published 2026 best pressure washers
- "4K deep cleaning" videos getting millions of views

**Mr. George React Post (FB/IG):**
> "There's a reason pressure washing videos are the most satisfying thing on the internet 🤤 But here's what most people don't know: wrong PSI = destroyed concrete. Zero-degree nozzle = emergency room visit. Even Consumer Reports says skip the zero-degree tip. Let a pro handle it — or at least start with 15-degree and work your way up. Your driveway will thank you. 💦🏠"

**TikTok Script Idea:**
- Split screen: satisfying pro wash vs DIY disaster
- "What your driveway looks like vs what it COULD look like"
