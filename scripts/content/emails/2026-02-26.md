# UpTend Email Templates — Feb 26, 2026

---

## 1. Nurture Email (Visited but didn't book)

**Subject:** Spring's coming, {{first_name}} — is your home ready?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

March is the perfect time to knock out the stuff winter left behind — clogged gutters, pressure washing the driveway, or finally tackling that overgrown yard.

Most homeowners in Orlando wait until it's 95° and everything costs more. Getting ahead now saves you money and headaches.

If you want a quick quote, just reply to this email or hop on [uptendapp.com](https://uptendapp.com) — takes about 60 seconds.

Talk soon,
Alan
