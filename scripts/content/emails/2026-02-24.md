## 1. Nurture Email (Website Visitors Who Didn't Book)

**Subject:** Spring's coming, {{first_name}} — is your home ready?

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

March is the #1 month for gutter damage in Central Florida. All that pollen and debris from winter builds up fast.

Quick checklist before spring hits:
- Gutters clear? (clogged = water damage)
- Pressure wash the driveway before it stains permanently
- AC filters swapped out?

If any of that sounds like a headache, we handle all of it — and you can get a quote in under 60 seconds.
