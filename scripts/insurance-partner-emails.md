Hi Thimble Partnerships Team,

I'm Alan Oney, CEO of UpTend (uptendapp.com), a home services marketplace launching in Orlando, FL. We connect homeowners with background-checked, insured pros for services like junk removal, pressure washing, landscaping, cleaning, and handyman work.

We're building out our insurance infrastructure and believe Thimble is the ideal partner for our pro network. Here's what we're looking for:

**Our Insurance Model (Tiered Ramp):**
- $0-$1,000 in platform earnings: Covered by UpTend's platform policy (no cost to pro)
- $1,000-$5,000: Per-job coverage recommended ($5-12/job range)
- $5,000+: Monthly GL policy required to continue accepting jobs

**What We Need:**
- Embedded GL policies for our pro network (general liability, per-job and monthly options)
- Pre-filled signup links so pros can get covered in 60 seconds from our dashboard
- API integration for real-time policy status (activation, renewal, cancellation, expiration)
- Webhook support for auto-updating pro insurance status in our system
- Per-job coverage API for on-demand coverage tied to specific service requests

**Our Scale:**
- Launching with 50-100 pros in Orlando metro, scaling to 500+ in Year 1
- 13 service categories across home services
- Average job value: $150-$350

**Revenue Opportunity:**
- We're interested in a partner commission structure on policies originated through our platform
- Every pro on our platform will see Thimble as the recommended insurance provider
- Integrated directly into our pro dashboard and signup flow

**Integration Preferences:**
- API-first (REST/webhook)
- Pre-filled quote links with partner tracking parameters
- Policy status webhooks for automated compliance tracking

I'd love to schedule a call to discuss how we can work together. We're ready to integrate immediately.

Alan Oney
