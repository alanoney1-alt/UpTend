# Sources & Uses

## UpTend, Inc. — Capital Deployment Plan

## SOURCES OF CAPITAL

| Source | Amount | Terms |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Lead Investor (confirmed) | $100,000 | 10% equity at $1M valuation (SAFE + warrant) |
| Network Raise (via lead investor) | $400,000 | 8% combined at $5M pre-money valuation |
| **Total Capital** | **$500,000** | |

**Cap Table Post-Raise:** 50% Founder / 22% Allocated Investors / 18% Remaining Insider Pool / 10% ESOP

---

## THE STRATEGY

**Phase 1 ($100K):** Build the app, recruit HOAs and business partners, launch social media brand. Every HOA contract brings recurring revenue across multiple service verticals AND onboards local pros to service those contracts. Business partners load their employees as pros on the platform. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem — supply and demand come through the same door.

**Phase 2 ($400K):** Scale what's working. Hire a CTO. More HOAs, more business partners, deeper marketing. Then leverage the built-out pro network to go after government contracts — the pros are already vetted, certified, and performing. Government is the high-margin play once the workforce is proven.

## THE FLYWHEEL

```
HOA/Business Partners sign up
        ↓
Their employees become pros on the platform
        ↓
Pros service HOA properties + consumer jobs
        ↓
Track record + certifications build
        ↓
Qualified to bid on government contracts
        ↓
Government revenue funds further growth
        ↓
More partners, more pros, more contracts
```

**One HOA contract = recurring revenue across 5+ service verticals from a single relationship.** Landscaping 2x/month, pressure washing quarterly, pool weekly, gutter cleaning seasonal, handyman as-needed. A 200-unit HOA generates $8,000-12,000/month.

**One business partner = 5-20 pros onboarded at zero recruitment cost.** They bring their own workforce. We bring them jobs, technology, and insurance.

**Government contracts = highest margins, longest terms, most stable revenue.** But they require a proven workforce with background checks, certifications, and track record. Phases 1-2 build exactly that.
