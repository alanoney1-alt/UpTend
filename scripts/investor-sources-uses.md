## CONSERVATIVE REVENUE PROJECTIONS

**Key Assumptions (all conservative):**
- Average job ticket: $250 (blended across services)
- Platform fee: 27% = $67.50 gross margin per job
- HOA contract value: $10,000/month recurring (landscaping 2x/mo + pressure washing quarterly + pool weekly + handyman as-needed across 200 units)
- Consumer customer acquisition cost: $40 blended (Google LSA $35 CPL at 50% close + Facebook $45 CPA at 40% close + organic/referral at $0)
- Pro churn: 15% annually
- HOA close rate: 1 per 15 presentations (conservative B2B benchmark)
- No subscription revenue, no B2B PM revenue, no affiliate revenue modeled (all upside)

### Unit Economics at Scale (Month 12)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average job ticket | $250 |
| Platform take rate | 27% |
| Gross margin per job | $67.50 |

## INSURANCE SUMMARY

Total insurance investment across both phases: **$17,600**

| Policy | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Annual at Scale |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| General Liability ($1M → $2M/$4M) | $1,068 | $2,400 | $2,400 |
| Professional Liability / E&O | $1,051 | $1,800 | $1,800 |
| Workers' Comp / Contractor Coverage | $888 | $1,800 | $1,800 |
| Commercial Umbrella ($2M → $5M) | $900 | $1,800 | $1,800 |
| Surety Bonds | $500 | $2,500 | Varies by contract |
| Cyber Liability | (bundled) | $1,900 | $1,900 |
| Business Property / Cyber bundle | $993 | $1,200 | $1,200 |
| **Total** | **$5,400** | **$12,200** | **$10,900/yr ongoing** |

**Why insurance matters:** HOAs and property managers will not sign a vendor contract with an uninsured platform. This is table stakes for B2B revenue. At scale, the $10/job insurance surcharge for uninsured pros makes insurance self-funding at ~90 jobs/month.

## INVESTOR PROTECTIONS

- SAFE with warrant — standard Y Combinator structure
- Board observer seat for lead investor
- Quarterly financial reporting (P&L, KPIs, customer metrics)
- Right of first refusal on follow-on rounds
- Pro-rata rights to maintain ownership percentage

---

## THE ASK

$500,000 total capital deploys across 12 months to reach $1M ARR run rate, 100+ pros, 5+ HOA contracts, and a hired CTO — positioning UpTend for a $3-5M Series A at $15-25M valuation.

The technology is built and live. This funds customers, pros, insurance, and a CTO — not a build.
