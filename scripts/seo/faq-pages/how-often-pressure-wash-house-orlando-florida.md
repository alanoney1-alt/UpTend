# How Often Should You Pressure Wash Your House in Orlando, Florida?

*Last Updated: February 24, 2026 | FAQ Category: Home Maintenance*

Orlando's unique climate creates specific challenges for home exterior maintenance. Between humidity, frequent rain, intense UV exposure, and seasonal pollen, Central Florida homes accumulate dirt, mildew, and organic growth faster than most regions.

## Quick Answer

**Most Orlando homes should be pressure washed every 12-18 months.** However, your specific schedule depends on several local factors including your home's location, surrounding vegetation, and seasonal exposure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why do Orlando homes need pressure washing more often than other areas?

**A: Florida's climate accelerates exterior buildup.**

Orlando's environmental factors create the perfect storm for exterior contamination:
- **High humidity** (average 74% annually) promotes mold and mildew growth
- **Frequent afternoon thunderstorms** spread dirt and organic matter
- **Year-round growing season** means constant pollen and plant debris
- **Hurricane season** brings salt spray and storm debris inland
- **Intense UV exposure** breaks down protective coatings faster

### Q: How often should different parts of my Orlando home be pressure washed?

**A: Different surfaces have different needs.**

**Annually (Every 12 Months):**
- House siding and exterior walls
- Front entrance and walkways
- Pool decks and lanai areas
- Driveways and main pathways

**Bi-Annually (Every 18-24 Months):**
- Roof cleaning (soft wash method)
- Privacy fences and gates
- Outdoor furniture and fixtures
- Secondary patios and walkways

**As Needed (Seasonal or Situational):**
- After hurricane season (September-November)
- During heavy pollen season (February-April)
- Following construction or landscaping projects
- When mold/mildew becomes visible

### Q: What happens if I wait too long between pressure washing sessions?

**A: Delayed maintenance creates bigger problems.**

**6-12 Months Overdue:**
- Mold and mildew staining becomes harder to remove
- Requires stronger chemicals or multiple treatments
- Surface damage becomes more likely

**1-2 Years Overdue:**
- Permanent staining may occur on certain materials
- Roof shingles can deteriorate from algae growth
- Property value and curb appeal suffer significantly

**2+ Years Overdue:**
- May require professional restoration instead of routine cleaning
- Some surfaces may need replacement rather than cleaning
- HOA violations possible in managed communities

### Q: Does my home's location in Orlando affect pressure washing frequency?

**A: Yes, location significantly impacts your schedule.**

**More Frequent Cleaning Needed (Every 8-12 Months):**
- **Near lakes or water bodies** (Lake Nona, Dr Phillips waterfront)
- **Heavy tree cover** (Winter Park, College Park)
- **Construction zones** (new developments)
- **High-traffic areas** (major road frontage)

**Standard Schedule (12-18 Months):**
- **Suburban neighborhoods** with moderate landscaping
- **Master-planned communities** with controlled environments
- **Newer construction** with modern materials

**Less Frequent (18-24 Months):**
- **Desert landscaping** with minimal vegetation
- **Newer homes** with high-quality, resistant materials
- **Protected areas** with limited environmental exposure

### Q: What about HOA requirements in Orlando communities?

**A: Many Orlando HOAs have specific maintenance standards.**

**Common HOA Requirements:**
- Annual exterior cleaning requirement

- Professional services for certain surfaces
- Documentation of maintenance for compliance

**Popular HOA Communities with Strict Standards:**
- Lake Nona (various subdivisions)
- Dr Phillips area communities
- Windermere planned communities
- Winter Park residential areas

**Pro Tip**: Check your HOA guidelines before scheduling. Some require advance notice or approved contractors.

### Q: Should I pressure wash before or after Orlando's rainy season?

**A: Timing matters for best results.**

**Best Times to Pressure Wash:**
- **Late Fall** (November-December): After hurricane season, before winter guests
- **Early Spring** (February-March): After winter buildup, before summer humidity
- **Late Winter** (January-February): Take advantage of lower humidity

**Avoid These Times:**
- **Peak summer** (June-August): High humidity slows drying
- **Hurricane season** (June-November): Risk of immediate re-contamination
- **Heavy pollen season** (March-April): Immediate re-coating likely

### Q: Can I pressure wash my Orlando home myself or should I hire professionals?

**A: It depends on your home's specific needs.**

**DIY Appropriate For:**

- Routine maintenance (not heavy buildup)

**Professional Recommended For:**
- Two-story or complex architecture
