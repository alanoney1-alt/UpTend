*Published: March 1, 2026*

## Common Emergency Home Repairs in Central Florida

- Severe drain backups
- Toilet overflows

**Average Response Time:** 1-3 hours  
**Cost Range:** $150-$800

- Sparking outlets
- Tripped breakers that won't reset
- Burning smells from electrical panels

**Safety First:** If you smell burning, evacuate and call 911

### 4. Storm Damage Repairs
Central Florida's severe weather creates unique emergency needs:
