# Lead Scan — 2026-02-26

## Consumer Leads
**Slim pickings today.** No Orlando-specific home service requests found in the past week on Reddit, Nextdoor (not indexable), or general search. The r/orlando subreddit had no handyman/home service recommendation threads this week.

### Nearby (Not Orlando)
- **r/GNV** — Broken washing machine, needs handyman (Gainesville, not our market)
- **r/NoStupidQuestions** — "How do I hire a handyman?" (general, no location)

## B2B / Development Intel

### 🔥 Ellison Nona — 377-Unit Multifamily (HOT LEAD)
- **Developer:** Faver & Gray
- **Location:** Lake Nona
- **Status:** Active construction, multiple buildings in framing/exterior phase (Feb 2026 drone update)
- **Opportunity:** 377 units = massive ongoing maintenance contracts once occupied (cleaning, handyman, pressure washing, landscaping, pool). Target the property management company BEFORE lease-up begins.
- **Source:** https://favergray.com/ellison-nona-construction-update-february-progress-from-above/
- **Action:** Research who will manage Ellison Nona → reach out with B2B PM pitch

### Lake Nona Market Overview
- Active investment article (dreamlandestate.com, posted today) highlights Laureate Park and gated communities as growth areas
- YouTube video "Everything NEW and COMING SOON to Lake Nona in 2026" has market intel
- Lake Nona continues rapid growth in healthcare/tech employment → steady stream of new homeowners needing services

## HOA / Vendor RFPs
- Search rate-limited; no Orange County HOA RFPs found this scan. Will retry next cycle.

## Recommendations
1. **Priority: Ellison Nona B2B outreach** — Find the PM company and pitch UpTend's PM tier before they select vendors
2. **Nextdoor is the real goldmine** but isn't indexable via search — Alan should monitor Lake Nona Nextdoor manually or consider a Nextdoor business page
3. **r/orlando monitoring** — Set up a recurring check; threads appear sporadically
