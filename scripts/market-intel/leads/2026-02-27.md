## B2B / Market Intel

### 4. Lake Nona Growth — HOT MARKET INTEL 🔥
- **Source**: Multiple (dreamlandestate.com, centralfloridalifestyle.com, ark7.com)
- Lake Nona remains Orlando's fastest-growing neighborhood in 2026
- 259+ rental homes listed (apartments.com) = PM companies needing vendors
- "Multi-generational estates" trend = bigger homes = more services needed
- New construction still active — builder warranty expiration wave coming 2027-2028
- **Action**: Target Lake Nona HOAs and property managers for B2B tier

### 5. 2026 Florida HOA Law Changes
- **Source**: brownlawandtitle.com, daniafernandez.com
- New HOA transparency/budgeting laws effective 2026
- HOAs must now do more reserve studies + maintenance planning
- **Opportunity**: HOAs will need vendor relationships locked in for mandatory maintenance budgets
- **Action**: Position UpTend as the compliant, trackable vendor platform HOAs need for new reporting requirements

### 6. Lake Nona CDD Assessments ($1,500-$3,000+/year)
- **Source**: bhumicalculator.com
- Homeowners already paying steep CDD fees — price sensitivity is real
- **Opportunity**: Market UpTend's transparent pricing + Guaranteed Price Ceiling as the antidote to getting overcharged

## No Hot Leads Found On
- Nextdoor (not indexable by search engines — requires account access)
- Orange County RFP portals (no home-service RFPs this week)
- Facebook groups (not searchable via Brave)

## Summary
**No red-hot "someone needs help RIGHT NOW" leads in Orlando this week.** The r/orlando subreddit has been quiet on home services. The biggest opportunity remains **B2B outreach to Lake Nona HOAs/PMs** — the growth data is overwhelming and the new FL HOA laws create urgency.

**Recommendation**: Alan should focus outreach on Lake Nona property management companies and HOA boards. The 2026 HOA law changes are a perfect cold-email hook.
