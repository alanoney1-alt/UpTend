## Market Signals

- **Handyman is SATURATED** — 40+ active handyman listings on Orlando CL today. Most are solo operators posting $0 (no listed rates). Differentiation opportunity: UpTend's guaranteed payment + steady job flow is a real value prop here.
- **Bilingual is big** — Multiple Spanish-language listings (Mario, Isaias, Handyman Hispano). The bilingual pro pool in Orlando is significant. George's Spanish capability (Sr. Jorge) is a competitive advantage.
- **$30/hr is the going rate** — Multiple "moving labor / handyman" listings at $30/hr. UpTend's handyman rate of $75/hr with pro getting 75-82% ($56-62/hr) is a strong premium for skilled pros.
- **Pressure washing is active but less crowded** — Only ~10 dedicated listings vs 40+ handyman. Established companies (Titan, First Choice) dominate. Opportunity to recruit them as anchor pros.
- **Pool cleaning & landscaping are sparse on CL** — Very few dedicated listings. These pros are likely on Nextdoor/Facebook/Google instead. May need different sourcing strategy.
- **Junk removal is thin** — Only JJ Trash Valet found as a dedicated junk removal listing. Alan's A2 Non-A Junk Removal experience means he knows this market — could be an angle for recruiting.
- **Property management crossover** — Mario and Titan both explicitly mention working with PMs/HOAs. These are the pros to target for B2B pipeline.
- **TJ Handyman Services LLC** (tjhandymanservicesllc.com) — New/expanding in Lake Nona area, offering popcorn ceiling removal. Worth monitoring.
- **Lake Nona real estate is booming** — "Medical City" investment articles trending. More homes = more service demand. Good timing for pro recruitment in that zip code.

## Facebook / Nextdoor / Google Maps Notes

- **Facebook groups** could not be scraped directly (login wall), but Orlando Craigslist pros frequently cross-post to FB Marketplace and local groups like "Orlando Handyman Services" and "Lake Nona Community."
- **Nextdoor** requires authentication — recommend Alan post a "looking for pros" message in the Lake Nona neighborhood feed.
- **Google Maps signal:** TJ Handyman Services LLC actively expanding in Lake Nona area (new blog content targeting Lake Nona keywords as of this week). MINT Builders expanding kitchen remodeling services in Orlando (press release 2/19).
