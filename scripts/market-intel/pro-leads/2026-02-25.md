## Facebook Groups Identified
- **Orlando Home Services** (facebook.com/groups/OrlandoHandymanServices/) — active group for posting/scouting

## Market Signals
1. **Handyman market is saturated** — dozens of CL listings, many posting daily. Price competition is fierce ($30/hr labor ads). UpTend's guaranteed payment + steady jobs is a strong differentiator here.
2. **Pressure washing is seasonal peak** — spring cleaning season driving posts. Father & Son and several others are small operators who'd benefit from platform leads.
3. **Cleaning services booming** — multiple solo operators at $25-30/hr range. Many are immigrant-owned, bilingual. Spanish outreach would unlock a large pro pool.
4. **Lake Nona specifically underserved** — only a handful of dedicated Lake Nona operators found (Sgt. Junk, Lake Nona Pressure Washing, Came in Handy-Man). Huge opportunity to be THE platform for this growing area.
5. **Junk removal gap** — very few independent junk removal operators on CL compared to handyman/cleaning. This is a service where UpTend can dominate.
6. **Bilingual is a competitive edge** — A1 Handyman and others advertise Spanish. UpTend's Sr. Jorge AI could be a unique selling point for Spanish-speaking pros.
