- **UpTend Position:** Not found (page 1-2)
- **Top 3:** Tuff Bros Hauling, Junk Removal Rangers, Dumpster Crews
- **Competition:** Medium — mostly small local operators with location pages

- **Top 3:** Reddit r/orlando, Orlando Pressure Washing Pros, Wash Rite Cleaning
- **Competition:** HIGH — established local businesses with keyword-exact domains (orlandopressurewashpros.com, washingorlando.com)
- **Opportunity:** LOW — saturated market, exact-match domains dominate

### 3. "handyman orlando"

- **Top 3:** Yelp, Mr. Handyman (franchise), My Handyman Orlando
- **Competition:** HIGH — Yelp, franchises (Mr. Handyman, Ace, TaskRabbit), exact-match domains

### 5. "gutter cleaning orlando"
