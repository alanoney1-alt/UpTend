## Opportunity Threads (r/orlando)
These recent threads are places Alan could organically mention UpTend when ready:

1. **Pest control recs** (1 day ago) - Not UpTend's service area yet
2. **Homeowners of Orlando** (3 days ago) - General home maintenance discussion
3. **Window Replacement** (5 days ago) - Home improvement frustrations
