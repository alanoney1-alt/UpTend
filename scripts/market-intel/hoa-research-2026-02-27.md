# HOA Research Report: Orlando/Lake Nona Market Intel for UpTend B2B Outreach
**Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Purpose:** Target list for UpTend's B2B outreach leveraging 2026 FL HOA law changes

## Executive Summary

The 2026 Florida HOA legislation (HB 1021, SB 4-D) creates significant compliance pressure on HOA and condo associations, making vendor management platforms like UpTend essential. Key deadlines are January 1, 2026 (reserve funding) and ongoing compliance requirements create urgency for automation solutions.

## Key 2026 Florida HOA Law Changes & Business Hooks

### Critical Deadlines & Requirements

1. **SIRS (Structural Integrity Reserve Study) Requirements**
   - Deadline: December 31, 2025 (recently passed - creates urgency)
   - Full reserve funding required: **January 1, 2026** (immediate need)
   - Affects condos and co-ops 3+ stories

2. **Website Requirements** 
   - Condos 25+ units must have compliant website by **January 1, 2026**
   - Must include: budgets, financial reports, contracts, meeting minutes, bylaws
   - Previously only applied to 150+ unit buildings

3. **Reserve Funding Changes**
   - Projects $25,000+ must have sufficient reserves (up from $10,000)
   - Annual inflation adjustments starting February 1, 2026
   - Can be funded via loans, special assessments, lines of credit

4. **Director Education Requirements**
   - 4+ hours mandatory education for condo directors
   - Topics: elections, financial literacy, recordkeeping, enforcement

### UpTend Value Propositions Based on Law Changes

- **Vendor Management Crisis:** Reserve studies require coordinating multiple licensed professionals (engineers, architects, certified reserve specialists) - perfect for vendor management platform
- **Document Compliance:** Website requirements create need for centralized document management and automated compliance tracking
- **Financial Tracking:** New reserve thresholds and annual reporting create need for better budget/expense tracking
- **Penalty Avoidance:** Serious legal penalties (misdemeanors, felonies) for non-compliance - ROI through risk avoidance
