The `scrape.ts` script hung on execution (likely fetch timeouts to Craigslist/Reddit). Manual web search used instead. Script needs debugging (timeout handling, retry logic).

## 🏠 Lake Nona Specific

### Housing Market
- Orlando housing market update (Reddit r/orlando, 2 days ago): Average home prices slightly dropped in Orlando, significant drop in Winter Park YoY. Users asking specifically about **Laureate Park / Lake Nona** area — strong interest signal.
- "Investing in Lake Nona 2026" article published TODAY — positioning Lake Nona as "Medical City" for investors. More new homeowners = more home service demand.

### Local Competition
- **Square Build LLC** actively marketing outdoor kitchen renovations in Lake Nona (6 days ago)
- **The Pressure Specialist** (407-721-9878) ranking well for "pressure washing Orlando" — licensed & insured, direct competitor
- No major junk removal competitors specifically targeting Lake Nona yet — **opportunity window**

## 📊 SEO / Competitor Rankings
- "Orlando pressure washing": The Pressure Specialist dominating organic. UpTend not visible yet.
- "Orlando junk removal": National aggregators (Move.org, SoSoActive) own top spots. Local gap exists.
- "Lake Nona home services": No dominant local platform — **wide open for UpTend**

## 🔴 Reddit Demand Signals
- r/homeowners (3 days ago): "What to look for in a good cleaning company?" — window, gutter, roof cleaning
- r/CleaningTips (1 week ago): Commercial cleaning recommendations, with warnings about junk removal companies using "independent contractors" — trust/transparency angle plays to UpTend's strengths
- r/Roofing (3 weeks ago): Gutter fixing + pressure washing roof inquiry
- No Orlando-specific service recommendation threads this week (r/orlando focused on housing market)

## 💰 Pricing Intel
- Junk removal industry 2026: $50-$1,000+ range (volume-based). UpTend pricing competitive.
- Pressure washing: market trending toward eco-friendly, electric equipment. DIY interest high but people still hiring for large jobs.
