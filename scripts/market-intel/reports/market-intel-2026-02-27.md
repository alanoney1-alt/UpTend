# Market Intel Digest — Feb 27, 2026

## 🏠 Lake Nona Specific

### Housing Market Signals
- r/orlando housing market thread (3 days ago) still active — users specifically asking about **Laureate Park / Lake Nona** pricing. Strong new homeowner pipeline.
- Lake Nona apartments (Ariel, Villagewalk) actively listing $1,688+ units — renters converting to homeowners = future service customers

### Local Competition

- "Orlando junk removal" / "Orlando pressure washing" — national aggregators dominate, local gap exists

## 🔴 Reddit Demand Signals (This Week)
