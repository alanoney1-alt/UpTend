# UpTend B2B Pitch: Three Wins in One Contract

_For property managers, HOA boards, and construction companies._

---

## Win 1: Their Residents Get George

**"Your residents get a personal home service agent. Free."**

Every resident in your property gets access to George. 24/7, instant, conversational. No calling the front office, no leaving voicemails, no waiting for callbacks.

- Resident texts George: "My AC is making a weird noise"
- George asks two diagnostic questions, checks the property contract, and either schedules a covered repair or gives a transparent quote for anything not covered
- Resident gets a confirmation, a time window, and a real person shows up

**Why PMs care:** Resident satisfaction is retention. Retention is their entire business model. If tenants feel like maintenance is instant and effortless, they renew leases. Every lease renewal is worth thousands to the PM.

**Why HOAs care:** Board members stop getting angry emails about slow maintenance. Homeowners feel like they're getting something for their dues. Complaints at board meetings drop.

**The line:** "You're not just hiring a maintenance vendor. You're giving every resident a personal concierge that happens to know their home better than they do."

## Win 2: Their Office Gets a Dashboard

**"Your team gets real-time visibility into every job, every property, every dollar."**

The UpTend PM Dashboard gives their office staff:

- **Live job tracking**: Every active service, who's doing it, where they are, ETA
- **Property health scores**: Which buildings need attention, which are in great shape, predictive maintenance alerts before things break
- **Spending analytics**: Cost per property, cost per unit, month over month trends, budget vs actual
- **ESG compliance reports**: Auto-generated environmental, social, governance metrics. One click export for board presentations or investor reporting
- **Maintenance history**: Full service timeline per property. When the roof was last cleaned, when gutters were done, what's overdue
- **Vendor scorecards**: Response time, completion rate, resident satisfaction per job

**Why PMs care:** They're managing hundreds or thousands of doors in spreadsheets and email chains. This replaces all of that. Their office staff spends less time coordinating and more time on revenue-generating work.

**Why HOAs care:** Board transparency. Every dollar of dues spent on maintenance is tracked, reported, and justified. No more "where did the money go" at annual meetings. ESG reports make the community look progressive for prospective buyers.

**The line:** "Your current vendor sends you an invoice. We send you intelligence."

## Win 3: The Actual Service Work

**"Trained W2 crews. Consistent quality. One vendor for everything."**

- 12 service verticals under one contract. No juggling six different vendors with six different invoices and six different quality levels.
- W2 employees, not random gig workers. Background checked, trained, insured, branded. Same crew shows up every time so they learn the property.
- Recurring schedules handled automatically. Monthly pool cleaning, quarterly pressure washing, seasonal gutter cleaning. Set it once, it just happens.
- Emergency response. Pipe burst at 2am in unit 304? George takes the call, dispatches a crew, notifies the PM, logs everything.

**Why this beats their current setup:** Most PMs and HOAs have a rolodex of "guys." The plumber who's decent, the landscaper who's cheap, the pressure washer who showed up that one time. No consistency, no tracking, no accountability. Half of them don't carry proper insurance. None of them talk to each other.

UpTend replaces the entire rolodex with one relationship.

**The line:** "One contract. One dashboard. One AI agent. Every service your property needs."

## The Close

"Every property management company and HOA has maintenance vendors. None of them have an AI agent that knows every unit, a dashboard that tracks every dollar, and a trained crew that handles every service. That's what UpTend is. And your residents will think you're a genius for finding us."

## Contract Routing (How It Actually Works)

When a B2B contract is signed, every property gets registered in our system. George automatically knows:

1. **Is this address under a B2B contract?**
2. **Is the requested service covered?**
3. **Route accordingly:**
   - Covered service → W2 crew, billed to PM/HOA, no cost to resident
   - Not covered → consumer marketplace, transparent pricing to resident
   - No contract → standard consumer booking

The resident never sees the routing. They just talk to George and everything gets handled.

One property can generate revenue through both channels simultaneously: B2B contract work + individual resident marketplace bookings.
