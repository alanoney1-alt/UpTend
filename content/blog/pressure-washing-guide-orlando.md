# Pressure Washing in Orlando: What Every Homeowner Should Know

Living in Orlando means your home takes a beating from the elements year-round. Between the humidity, afternoon thunderstorms, and subtropical climate, mold, mildew, and algae build up on exterior surfaces faster here than almost anywhere else in the country.

I am Mr. George, and pressure washing is one of the most common services I recommend to Central Florida homeowners. Done right, it protects your property, boosts curb appeal, and prevents long-term damage. Done wrong, it can destroy surfaces and cost you more in repairs than the cleaning was worth.

Here is what you need to know.

## Why Pressure Washing Matters More in Orlando

In drier climates, a home can go years without exterior cleaning. In Central Florida, that is not an option. Our combination of heat, moisture, and shade creates ideal conditions for organic growth. That dark streaking on your roof is not dirt — it is Gloeocapsa magma, a cyanobacteria that feeds on limestone filler in asphalt shingles. The green film on your driveway is algae. The black patches on your lanai screen are mold.

Left untreated, these organisms do real damage. Algae makes concrete dangerously slippery. Mold degrades wood and stucco. Roof algae shortens shingle lifespan by years. Regular pressure washing is not cosmetic — it is preventive maintenance.

## What Should Be Pressure Washed and How Often

**Driveway and walkways:** Every 12 to 18 months. Concrete is porous and absorbs stains quickly in our climate. Regular cleaning prevents the deep discoloration that becomes permanent.

**House exterior (stucco, siding, brick):** Annually. Orlando homes accumulate a visible layer of grime, pollen, and mildew every year. Soft washing — which uses lower pressure and a cleaning solution — is the correct method for most exterior walls.

**Roof:** Every 2 to 3 years. Never use high-pressure water on a roof. Soft washing is the only appropriate method. High pressure strips granules from shingles and voids many manufacturer warranties.

**Pool deck and lanai:** Every 12 months. These areas stay wet frequently and are prime territory for algae and mold in Florida.

**Fence:** Every 1 to 2 years depending on material. Wood fences need lower pressure than vinyl or aluminum.

## Common Pressure Washing Mistakes

**Using too much pressure.** This is the most frequent mistake homeowners make. A 3,000 PSI gas washer will etch concrete, gouge wood, damage stucco, and strip paint. Most residential cleaning should be done between 1,500 and 2,000 PSI, and many surfaces require soft washing at even lower pressures.

**Skipping the detergent.** Pressure alone does not kill mold and algae — it just knocks them loose temporarily. Without a proper cleaning solution, growth returns within weeks. A sodium hypochlorite-based soft wash solution kills organisms at the root.

**Ignoring the direction of water flow.** Spraying upward under siding, soffits, or window frames forces water into places it was never designed to go. Always spray downward or at a neutral angle.

**Pressure washing windows.** High-pressure water shatters glass and destroys seals. Windows should be cleaned separately with appropriate tools.

## How Much Does Pressure Washing Cost in Orlando?

For professional service in the Orlando metro area, expect the following ranges:

- **Driveway (standard 2-car):** $100 to $200
- **Full house exterior:** $200 to $500 depending on square footage
- **Roof soft wash:** $250 to $600
- **Pool deck:** $100 to $250
- **Full property package:** $400 to $900

These prices reflect professional-grade equipment, proper detergents, and experienced operators. Budget services that undercut these ranges often use inadequate equipment or skip the chemical treatment, which means the results will not last.

## DIY vs. Professional Pressure Washing

Renting a pressure washer from a home improvement store costs around $50 to $100 per day. But the risk of damage is real. I have seen homeowners etch permanent lines into their driveways, blast holes in window screens, and strip the texture off stucco — all in a single afternoon.

If you are comfortable with a pressure washer and plan to clean flat concrete surfaces, a DIY approach can work. For anything involving your roof, exterior walls, or painted surfaces, hire a professional. The cost of repairing damage from improper pressure washing far exceeds the cost of having it done right the first time.
