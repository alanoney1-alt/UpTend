# 5 Signs Your Water Heater Is About to Fail (and What to Do)

Most homeowners in Orlando never think about their water heater until the morning they step into a freezing cold shower. By then, the damage is already done — and in many cases, there is water pooling across the garage floor or seeping into drywall.

I am Mr. George, and after years of helping Central Florida homeowners maintain their properties, I can tell you that water heater failure is one of the most preventable disasters in a home. The key is knowing what to look for before the unit gives out entirely.

## Sign 1: Your Water Heater Is Over 10 Years Old

The average tank water heater lasts between 8 and 12 years. If yours is approaching that range, it is living on borrowed time. You can find the age of your unit by checking the serial number on the manufacturer's sticker — the first two digits typically represent the year of production.

In Central Florida, our hard water accelerates sediment buildup inside the tank, which means many units here fail closer to the 8-year mark. If your heater is over a decade old, start budgeting for a replacement even if it seems to be working fine.

## Sign 2: Rusty or Discolored Hot Water

When you turn on the hot water and it comes out with a reddish or brownish tint, that is a sign of corrosion inside the tank. The anode rod — a sacrificial metal component designed to attract corrosive elements — has likely deteriorated completely, and the tank walls are now rusting from the inside out.

Test this by filling a few buckets with hot water only. If the discoloration is consistent, the tank is the source. If it clears up after a bucket or two, the issue may be in the pipes instead.

## Sign 3: Strange Noises Coming from the Tank

Popping, cracking, or rumbling sounds from your water heater indicate a thick layer of sediment has settled at the bottom of the tank. As the burner heats water trapped beneath that sediment, it creates those unsettling sounds.

This sediment layer forces the unit to work harder, driving up your energy bills and accelerating wear on the tank. Annual flushing can extend the life of the heater, but once the noises become persistent, the damage is often too advanced for maintenance alone.

## Sign 4: Leaking Around the Base

Any moisture or pooling water around the base of your water heater demands immediate attention. Small leaks can quickly become catastrophic failures. In Orlando homes where the water heater sits in the garage next to drywall or storage, a full tank rupture can cause thousands of dollars in water damage.

Check the temperature and pressure relief valve and the drain valve first. If those are dry and the leak appears to come from the tank itself, replacement is the only option. A cracked tank cannot be repaired.

## Sign 5: Inconsistent Water Temperature

If your hot water fluctuates between scalding and lukewarm without anyone adjusting the thermostat, the heating elements or thermostat are failing. In electric units, this is sometimes repairable. In gas units, it often signals a deeper issue with the burner assembly.

When the cost of repair approaches 50 percent of a new unit, replacement is the smarter investment — especially on an older system.

## What Should You Do?

If you are noticing one or more of these signs, do not wait for a complete failure. A planned replacement costs significantly less than an emergency one, and it spares you the water damage that often accompanies a burst tank.

Here in Orlando, a standard 40- to 50-gallon tank water heater replacement typically runs between $900 and $1,800 depending on the unit type and installation complexity. Tankless upgrades range from $1,500 to $3,500 but offer longer lifespans and lower monthly energy costs.

The best move is to get an honest assessment from a professional who can inspect the unit and give you a straight answer about remaining life expectancy.
