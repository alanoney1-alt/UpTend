# Hurricane Season Home Prep: The Complete Orlando Checklist

Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, and every year I watch Orlando homeowners scramble to prepare their homes after the first tropical storm warning hits the news. By that point, every contractor is booked, every hardware store is stripped of plywood, and you are making decisions under pressure.

I am Mr. George, and I want you to be ready long before the first storm forms. This checklist covers everything you should address before hurricane season begins — ideally in April or May, when contractors are available and supplies are in stock.

## Roof and Exterior

**Inspect your roof.** Missing, cracked, or curling shingles are the weak points where wind-driven rain enters your home. If your roof is over 15 years old, have a professional inspection done. In Orlando, a roof inspection typically costs $150 to $400 and can save you from catastrophic interior water damage.

**Secure loose tiles or shingles.** Even a single loose shingle becomes a projectile in hurricane-force winds and creates an entry point for water.

**Check flashing and seals.** The flashing around vents, skylights, and chimneys is a common failure point. Ensure all seals are intact and reapply roofing caulk where needed.

**Inspect soffits and fascia.** Damaged or loose soffits allow wind to get under your roof decking, which can lead to the roof lifting off entirely. This is one of the most overlooked vulnerabilities in Central Florida homes.

**Clean and secure gutters.** Clogged gutters cause water to pool and overflow during heavy rain, leading to fascia rot and foundation erosion. Ensure gutters are clean, firmly attached, and draining properly.

## Windows and Doors

**Install or test hurricane shutters.** If you have shutters, deploy them before the season to confirm they fit properly and all hardware is functional. Corroded bolts and missing wing nuts are common problems discovered too late.

**Stock plywood if you lack shutters.** Pre-cut 5/8-inch plywood panels for every window and label them. Store them in the garage so you are not fighting crowds at Home Depot when a storm is 48 hours out.

**Check weather stripping on all exterior doors.** Wind-driven rain pushes water through even small gaps. Replace worn or damaged weather stripping.

**Reinforce your garage door.** The garage door is the largest opening in most homes and the most vulnerable to wind pressure. A garage door bracing kit costs $50 to $200 and can prevent catastrophic structural failure.

## Yard and Landscaping

**Trim trees and remove dead branches.** Dead or overhanging branches become dangerous projectiles in high winds. Focus on branches hanging over your roof, power lines, or your neighbor's property.

**Secure or store outdoor furniture.** Patio furniture, grills, potted plants, and decorations need to come inside or be firmly anchored. Anything loose in your yard becomes a projectile.

**Remove yard debris and junk.** Old lumber, unused play equipment, broken furniture — anything sitting in your yard adds to the projectile hazard. Get it removed well before storm season.

**Check your fence.** Loose fence posts and damaged panels are both vulnerable to wind and dangerous to neighboring properties. Repair or replace compromised sections.

## Utilities and Systems

**Service your generator.** If you own a generator, run it, change the oil, and replace the spark plug. Store fresh fuel with stabilizer. If you do not own one, a portable generator capable of running a refrigerator and a few fans runs $400 to $1,200.

**Know your shutoff locations.** Be able to shut off water, gas, and electricity quickly. Label these shutoffs so any adult in the household can find them.

**Clear drains and French drains.** Orlando homes with poor drainage flood during heavy rain events even without a hurricane. Ensure all exterior drains are clear of debris and flowing properly.

**Test your sump pump.** If you have one, test it now. If it fails during a storm, your options are extremely limited.

## Emergency Supplies

Keep a hurricane kit stocked by June 1 with at minimum:

- Water: one gallon per person per day for at least three days
- Non-perishable food for three days
- Flashlights and extra batteries
- First aid kit
- Important documents in a waterproof container
- Cash in small bills (ATMs and card readers fail during power outages)
- Full tank of gas in every vehicle
- Medications for at least a seven-day supply
- Phone chargers and a portable battery pack

## Start Early and Stay Ahead

The single biggest mistake Orlando homeowners make is waiting until a storm is in the forecast. Contractors are swamped, materials are sold out, and prices surge. Handle your preparations in the spring when you can take your time, compare quotes, and get the work done right.
