# Pool Maintenance 101: A Florida Homeowner's Guide

Owning a pool in Florida is practically a birthright. Nearly a third of homes in the Orlando metro area have one, and for good reason — we use them year-round. But a pool that is not properly maintained goes from a backyard oasis to an expensive, green-tinted liability faster than most new pool owners expect.

I am Mr. George, and this guide covers the fundamentals every Florida pool owner needs to understand — whether you maintain it yourself or hire a service.

## The Chemistry Basics

Pool water chemistry is not optional. It is the difference between a safe, clear pool and a breeding ground for bacteria and algae. Here are the numbers you need to know:

**pH: 7.2 to 7.6.** This is the most critical measurement. Low pH (acidic) corrodes equipment and irritates skin and eyes. High pH (basic) reduces chlorine effectiveness and causes scaling. In Central Florida, our water tends to run slightly alkaline, so you will likely need to add muriatic acid or pH decreaser regularly.

**Free chlorine: 1 to 3 ppm.** Chlorine is your primary sanitizer. In Florida's heat and sun, chlorine depletes faster than in cooler climates. Test levels at least twice per week during summer.

**Cyanuric acid (stabilizer): 30 to 50 ppm.** This chemical protects chlorine from UV degradation. Without it, the Florida sun can burn through your chlorine in hours. With too much, chlorine becomes ineffective. If your stabilizer level creeps above 80 ppm, the only reliable solution is draining and refilling a portion of the pool water.

**Total alkalinity: 80 to 120 ppm.** Alkalinity buffers pH and prevents rapid swings. Adjust this before trying to dial in your pH.

**Calcium hardness: 200 to 400 ppm.** Orlando's water is relatively hard, so monitor this to prevent scaling on tile and equipment.

Test your water at least twice a week during the warm months and weekly during the cooler season. A quality liquid test kit is more accurate than test strips and costs around $25 to $40.

## The Weekly Routine

A well-maintained pool requires consistent weekly attention:

**Skim the surface daily or every other day.** Florida's abundant trees, insects, and afternoon storms drop debris into pools constantly. Skimming prevents organic material from sinking and decomposing, which consumes chlorine and feeds algae.

**Brush the walls and floor weekly.** Algae begins as an invisible film before it becomes the green bloom you can see. Brushing disrupts this growth before it takes hold. Pay special attention to steps, corners, and areas with poor circulation.

**Vacuum weekly.** A manual vacuum or automatic pool cleaner should address the floor at least once per week. Robotic cleaners in the $300 to $800 range are a worthwhile investment for Florida pool owners.

**Clean the skimmer and pump baskets weekly.** Full baskets reduce water flow and stress your pump. A pump running with restricted flow overheats and fails prematurely. Pump replacements run $400 to $1,200 in Orlando.

**Backwash or clean the filter as needed.** Sand filters need backwashing when pressure rises 8 to 10 PSI above the clean baseline. Cartridge filters need hosing off every two to four weeks and replacement annually. DE filters need backwashing and periodic recharging.

## Common Florida Pool Mistakes

**Running the pump too few hours.** In Florida's heat, your pool pump should run 8 to 12 hours per day during summer. Cutting run time to save on electricity invites algae blooms that cost far more to resolve than the electricity you saved. A variable-speed pump can cut energy costs by 60 to 80 percent while maintaining proper circulation.

**Ignoring phosphate levels.** Phosphates are algae food, and they enter your pool from landscaping runoff, fertilizer, and organic debris — all abundant in Central Florida. If you are maintaining proper chlorine levels but still battling algae, test for phosphates. A phosphate remover may solve the problem.

**Neglecting the pool deck.** The area around your pool matters too. Dirty, algae-covered pool decks are slip hazards and contribute contaminants to the water. Pressure wash your pool deck at least annually.

**Draining the pool.** Never fully drain a pool in Florida without professional guidance. The water table in much of Central Florida is high enough that an empty pool can literally pop out of the ground. This is not an exaggeration — it happens, and the repair costs are staggering.

## DIY vs. Professional Pool Service

Weekly pool service in Orlando typically runs $100 to $200 per month, which includes chemical balancing, skimming, brushing, and basic equipment checks. Many homeowners find this worthwhile, especially during the summer months when chemical demand is highest and maintenance is most intensive.

If you prefer DIY, budget approximately $50 to $100 per month for chemicals and supplies. You will also need a test kit, a telescopic pole, a skimmer net, a brush, and a vacuum — an initial investment of $150 to $300.

The DIY approach works well for homeowners who are consistent and willing to learn. Where it falls apart is when life gets busy and the pool goes a week or two without attention. In Florida, two weeks of neglect during summer can turn a clear pool into a swamp that costs $200 to $400 in shock treatment and extra chemicals to recover.

## Seasonal Considerations

Unlike northern states, Florida pools do not require winterization. However, the cooler months (December through February) do require reduced — not eliminated — maintenance. Drop your pump run time to 6 to 8 hours, reduce chemical additions, and continue testing weekly.

The most demanding period is June through September, when heat, rain, and heavy use combine to stress your water chemistry. Plan for higher chemical costs and more frequent attention during these months.

## Keep Your Pool Healthy

A well-maintained pool adds value to your home and quality to your life. A neglected one does the opposite.
