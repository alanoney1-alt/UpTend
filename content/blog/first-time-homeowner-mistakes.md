# 7 Maintenance Mistakes First-Time Homeowners Make

Buying your first home is exciting. Maintaining it is where reality sets in. I am Mr. George, and I work with homeowners across Orlando and Central Florida who are discovering — often the hard way — that a house requires consistent attention to stay healthy.

The good news is that most first-time homeowner mistakes are entirely avoidable. Here are the seven I see most often, and what you should do instead.

## Mistake 1: Ignoring the HVAC System

Your air conditioning system is the hardest-working appliance in your Orlando home. It runs nearly year-round in Central Florida, and it will fail prematurely if you neglect it.

At minimum, change your air filter every 30 to 60 days — not every 90 days as the packaging suggests. That recommendation was not written for subtropical climates where the system runs 10 to 12 months a year. Schedule professional maintenance twice annually: once before summer and once before the brief winter heating season.

An HVAC replacement in Orlando runs $5,000 to $15,000. A $150 maintenance visit twice a year is the best insurance policy you will ever buy.

## Mistake 2: Skipping Routine Exterior Maintenance

New homeowners tend to focus on the interior — paint colors, furniture, renovations — while the exterior quietly deteriorates. In Florida, exterior neglect accelerates fast. Mold and mildew colonize stucco within months. Gutters clog. Landscaping overgrows and traps moisture against the house.

Walk your property quarterly. Look for cracks in the stucco, discoloration on the walls, overgrown vegetation touching the house, standing water near the foundation, and debris in the gutters. Catching problems early is always cheaper than fixing them late.

## Mistake 3: Not Knowing Where the Shutoffs Are

Every homeowner should know the location of their main water shutoff, electrical panel, and gas shutoff (if applicable) on day one. When a pipe bursts at 2 AM, you do not have time to search.

Find them now. Label them. Show everyone in the household. This five-minute task can prevent thousands of dollars in water damage.

## Mistake 4: Treating Every Problem as a DIY Project

The internet has convinced a generation of homeowners that everything is a weekend project. Some things are. Many are not.

Electrical work, plumbing beyond a basic fixture swap, roof repairs, and anything involving your home's structure should be handled by licensed professionals. In Florida, unpermitted work can create serious problems when you sell the home or file an insurance claim. Know your limits and call a pro when the job exceeds them.

## Mistake 5: Neglecting the Water Heater

Most first-time homeowners have never thought about a water heater in their lives. It sits in the garage or a utility closet, silently doing its job — until it fails and floods the space around it.

Water heaters in Central Florida typically last 8 to 12 years. They should be flushed annually to remove sediment buildup, which is accelerated by our hard water. The temperature and pressure relief valve should be tested yearly. And if your unit is approaching the 10-year mark, start planning a replacement rather than waiting for an emergency.

## Mistake 6: Waiting Until Something Breaks

Reactive maintenance — fixing things only after they fail — is the most expensive approach to homeownership. A small roof leak ignored for six months becomes a ceiling collapse and a mold remediation project. A slow plumbing leak under a sink becomes subfloor rot.

Create a simple maintenance calendar. The major tasks for an Orlando home include:

- Monthly: HVAC filter replacement, pest inspection
- Quarterly: Exterior walkthrough, gutter check
- Biannually: HVAC professional service, pressure washing
- Annually: Water heater flush, roof inspection, plumbing check

Preventive maintenance is not glamorous, but it is the difference between a home that holds its value and one that slowly falls apart.

## Mistake 7: Underestimating Florida-Specific Challenges

If you moved to Orlando from a northern state, your maintenance instincts were calibrated for a different climate. Florida homes face challenges that do not exist elsewhere.

**Humidity and mold.** Indoor humidity should stay between 45 and 55 percent. Run your AC consistently and use dehumidifiers in enclosed spaces. Mold can establish itself in 24 to 48 hours in Florida conditions.

**Termites.** Subterranean termites are active year-round in Central Florida. Maintain your termite bond and have annual inspections. A termite bond costs a few hundred dollars per year. Termite damage repair costs thousands.

**Hurricane exposure.** Even if a major hurricane has not hit Orlando recently, the risk is real. Maintain your roof, trim your trees, and have a plan for storm shutters or plywood. Do not wait until a storm is in the forecast.

**Sun damage.** UV exposure degrades exterior paint, roof materials, and anything left outdoors. Exterior paint in Florida may need refreshing every 5 to 7 years compared to 10 to 15 years in cooler climates.

## Start Strong and Stay Consistent

Homeownership is a marathon, not a sprint. The homeowners who fare best are not the ones who spend the most — they are the ones who stay consistent with small, regular maintenance tasks.
