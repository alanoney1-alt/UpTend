# DIY vs. Hiring a Pro: How to Know When It's Time to Call

There is a satisfaction that comes with fixing something in your own home. I respect that. But I am Mr. George, and I have seen too many Orlando homeowners turn a $200 repair into a $2,000 disaster because they overestimated their skills or underestimated the complexity of the job.

Knowing when to handle something yourself and when to pick up the phone is one of the most valuable skills a homeowner can develop. Here is how I think about it.

## Jobs You Can Confidently Handle Yourself

**Painting interior walls.** With proper prep — cleaning, taping, priming — most homeowners can achieve professional-looking results. Invest in quality paint and rollers. Budget paint looks like budget paint.

**Replacing light fixtures and switches.** As long as you turn off the breaker first and the wiring is straightforward (matching colored wires), basic fixture and switch swaps are manageable. If you open the junction box and see aluminum wiring, knob-and-tube wiring, or anything that does not match the instructions, stop and call an electrician.

**Caulking and weatherstripping.** Sealing gaps around windows, doors, tubs, and sinks is a low-risk task that makes a real difference in energy efficiency and moisture control. A tube of quality silicone caulk costs under $10 and can prevent hundreds in water damage.

**Basic landscaping.** Mulching, planting, edging, and routine lawn maintenance are well within the ability of most homeowners. In Florida, keeping vegetation trimmed away from the house is critical for pest prevention and moisture control.

**Replacing toilet internals.** The flapper, fill valve, and flush valve in a toilet tank are designed for homeowner replacement. A running toilet wastes thousands of gallons of water per year and the fix takes 20 minutes.

**Changing HVAC filters.** This is not optional and it is not difficult. Know your filter size, buy in bulk, and replace every 30 to 60 days in Central Florida.

## Jobs That Require a Professional

**Electrical work beyond basic fixtures.** Adding circuits, upgrading panels, running new wiring, or anything involving your breaker box requires a licensed electrician. In Florida, unpermitted electrical work can void your homeowner's insurance and create fire hazards. The risk is simply not worth it.

**Plumbing beyond simple swaps.** Replacing a faucet is a DIY job. Repiping, rerouting drain lines, installing a water heater, or working with your main sewer line is not. Water damage from a plumbing mistake happens fast and costs a fortune to remediate.

**Roof work.** Working on a roof is dangerous, full stop. Beyond the fall risk, improper repairs void warranties and can cause leaks worse than the original problem. Florida roofing contractors must be licensed for good reason. Leave it to them.

**Mold remediation.** If you find mold covering more than about 10 square feet, professional remediation is necessary. Disturbing large mold colonies without proper containment spreads spores throughout your home and can cause serious health problems. In Florida's climate, mold is aggressive — do not underestimate it.

**HVAC repair and installation.** Cleaning your outdoor condenser coils with a hose is fine. Anything involving refrigerant, electrical components, or ductwork requires a licensed HVAC technician. Refrigerant handling in particular is regulated by federal law.

**Structural work.** Removing or modifying walls, repairing foundation issues, or addressing structural settling requires an engineer's assessment and a licensed contractor. Load-bearing wall mistakes can be catastrophic.

**Tree removal.** A small ornamental tree in the front yard might be a DIY project. Anything involving a chainsaw, a ladder, proximity to power lines, or a trunk diameter over 6 inches should be handled by a licensed and insured arborist. Tree work is one of the most dangerous categories of home maintenance, and fallen trees on structures or power lines create immediate emergencies.

## The Decision Framework

When deciding between DIY and professional help, ask yourself these questions:

1. **Does this require a permit in Florida?** If yes, hire a licensed professional. Unpermitted work creates legal and insurance complications.

2. **Could a mistake cause injury?** Electrical, structural, roofing, and tree work all carry serious injury risk. Your safety is worth more than the cost of hiring someone.

3. **Could a mistake cause damage exceeding the cost of hiring a pro?** A botched plumbing job that floods a room costs far more than the plumber would have charged.

4. **Do I have the right tools?** Many jobs require specialized equipment that costs more to buy or rent than hiring a professional. Pressure washers, drain snakes, and roofing tools fall into this category.

5. **Am I being honest about my skill level?** Watching a 10-minute video is not the same as having done a job before. There is no shame in recognizing when a task exceeds your experience.

## The Cost of Getting It Wrong

In Orlando, I regularly meet homeowners who attempted DIY work and ended up paying a professional to fix both the original problem and the damage caused by the attempt. A $300 plumbing call becomes $1,500 when there is water damage to repair. A $500 electrical job becomes $3,000 when wiring has to be redone to pass inspection.

The financial argument for DIY only works when you complete the job correctly the first time.

Before committing to a DIY approach, find out what the professional cost would actually be. Many homeowners assume professional service costs more than it does.

You might find that the professional price is closer to the cost of your materials alone — and you get the job done right with zero risk.
