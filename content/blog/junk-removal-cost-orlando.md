# How Much Does Junk Removal Cost in Orlando? (2026 Pricing Guide)

One of the most common questions I hear from Orlando homeowners is straightforward: how much does it cost to get rid of this stuff? Whether it is a garage full of accumulated clutter, an old couch that has seen better days, or the aftermath of a renovation, junk removal is something nearly every homeowner needs eventually.

I am Mr. George, and I want to give you an honest breakdown of what junk removal costs in the Orlando metro area in 2026 — no hidden fees, no bait-and-switch ranges.

## How Junk Removal Pricing Works

Most junk removal companies in Orlando price based on **volume** — how much space your items take up in the truck. The industry standard is a full-size truck with a bed measuring roughly 12 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 4 to 5 feet high. That gives you approximately 400 to 480 cubic feet of capacity per load.

Here are the typical price ranges for 2026 in the Orlando area:

- **Minimum load (single item or small pickup):** $75 to $150
- **Quarter truck load:** $150 to $300
- **Half truck load:** $300 to $450
- **Three-quarter truck load:** $400 to $550
- **Full truck load:** $500 to $700

These prices include labor, loading, hauling, and disposal fees. Reputable companies should provide a firm quote before any work begins — never agree to an open-ended estimate.

## Pricing by Item Type

Some homeowners just need a few specific items removed. Here are common single-item and category prices in Orlando:

**Furniture:**
- Couch or sofa: $75 to $150
- Mattress and box spring: $75 to $125
- Dining table and chairs: $100 to $175
- Large entertainment center or armoire: $100 to $200

**Appliances:**
- Refrigerator: $75 to $150
- Washer or dryer (each): $75 to $125
- Water heater: $75 to $150
- Dishwasher: $75 to $100

**Yard waste and debris:**
- General yard waste (per truck load): $200 to $500
- Hot tub removal: $300 to $600
- Fence removal and hauling: $200 to $600 depending on length and material
- Shed demolition and removal: $300 to $800

**Construction and renovation debris:**
- Drywall, lumber, tile (per half load): $250 to $400
- Full renovation cleanout: $500 to $1,200

## What Affects the Price

**Volume is the primary driver.** A full truck costs a full-truck price regardless of whether it is filled with feathers or concrete. However, exceptionally heavy loads — concrete, dirt, roofing shingles — may carry a surcharge because of dump fees and weight limits.

**Location of the items.** If your junk is in the driveway, loading is fast. If it is in a second-floor bedroom, up a narrow staircase, and through a hallway, it takes more time and labor. Some companies charge additional fees for difficult access; others include it in the quote.

**Type of material.** Hazardous materials — paint, chemicals, tires, certain electronics — require special disposal and typically cost extra or are not accepted by standard junk removal services. Check with your provider before assuming everything will be taken.

**Urgency.** Same-day or next-day service may carry a premium of $25 to $75 in the Orlando market. If you can be flexible on timing, you will often get better pricing.

## Junk Removal vs. Other Options

**Renting a dumpster.** For large cleanouts or renovation debris, a dumpster rental might be more economical. A 10-yard dumpster in Orlando rents for approximately $300 to $500 for a 7-day period, and a 20-yard runs $400 to $650. The trade-off is that you do all the loading yourself, and you need a place to put it — HOA rules and city ordinances may restrict dumpster placement.

**Hauling it yourself.** The Orange County landfill charges by weight, with minimum fees starting around $10 to $25 per trip. If you have a truck and the physical ability to load it, this is the cheapest option. But factor in your time, fuel, dump fees, and the potential for injury when lifting heavy or awkward items.

**Donation pickup.** Organizations like Habitat for Humanity ReStore and the Salvation Army offer free pickup for items in usable condition. This is a great option for furniture and appliances that still work. However, they will not take damaged, broken, or heavily worn items, and scheduling can take one to two weeks.

**Curbside bulk pickup.** Orange County and the City of Orlando offer periodic bulk pickup for residents, but schedules are limited and there are restrictions on what qualifies. It is a useful supplement but not a replacement for junk removal when you need items gone on your timeline.

## How to Get the Best Price

**Get multiple quotes.** Pricing varies significantly between companies. Three quotes gives you a reliable picture of the market rate for your specific job.

**Consolidate your items.** If you have junk scattered across the house and garage, gather it in one accessible location before the crew arrives. Faster loading means lower costs for jobs priced by time, and it ensures nothing gets overlooked.

**Be upfront about what you have.** Surprises on job day lead to price adjustments. If you have heavy items, second-floor removal, or potentially hazardous materials, mention it when requesting a quote.

**Book during off-peak times.** Late fall and winter are slower seasons for junk removal in Orlando. You may find better availability and pricing between November and February.
