# How Often Should You Clean Your Gutters in Florida?

If you live in Florida and cannot remember the last time you cleaned your gutters, you are overdue. I am Mr. George, and gutter neglect is one of the most common — and most damaging — maintenance oversights I see in Orlando homes.

The national recommendation is twice a year. In Florida, that is not enough.

## Why Florida Gutters Need More Attention

Central Florida has a unique combination of factors that fill gutters faster than the national average.

**Year-round foliage.** Unlike northern states where trees go dormant in winter, many Florida trees shed leaves, seeds, and debris throughout the year. Live oaks alone drop leaves in spring while simultaneously producing new growth. Palm trees shed fronds, seed pods, and flowers continuously.

**Heavy rainfall.** Orlando averages over 50 inches of rain per year, much of it falling in intense afternoon downpours during the wet season from June through September. Gutters clogged even partially cannot handle this volume, causing overflow that damages fascia, soffits, and foundations.

**Pollen and organic debris.** Florida's extended pollen season coats everything, including the inside of your gutters. This creates a sludge layer that traps additional debris and accelerates clogging.

**Wildlife.** Squirrels, birds, and even small reptiles use gutters for nesting. A single bird nest can block an entire downspout.

## The Recommended Schedule for Orlando Homes

For most Orlando properties, I recommend cleaning gutters **three to four times per year:**

- **Early spring (March):** Clear out winter debris and pollen buildup before the spring rains begin.
- **Early summer (June):** Clean before the peak of the wet season to ensure maximum drainage capacity.
- **Early fall (September/October):** Remove debris accumulated during the heavy rain months and prepare for the fall leaf drop.
- **Late fall/early winter (December):** Clear autumn debris and get the system ready for the dry season.

If your property has significant tree coverage — particularly live oaks, pines, or large palms — you may need to increase this to every two months.

## What Happens When You Skip Gutter Cleaning

**Fascia and soffit rot.** When gutters overflow, water runs behind the gutter and saturates the fascia board. In Florida's humidity, this wood rots quickly. Fascia replacement costs $600 to $2,500 depending on the length of your roofline.

**Foundation damage.** Gutters exist to direct water away from your foundation. When they overflow, water pools at the base of your home, eroding soil and potentially cracking the foundation over time. Foundation repairs in Central Florida start at $2,000 and can exceed $10,000.

**Roof damage.** Water backing up under shingles due to clogged gutters accelerates roof deterioration. In a state where roof insurance claims are already scrutinized heavily, maintaining proper drainage is essential.

**Mosquito breeding.** Standing water in clogged gutters is a prime mosquito breeding ground. In a state where mosquito-borne illness is a real concern, this is a public health issue, not just a comfort issue.

**Landscape erosion.** Overflowing gutters dump concentrated water flow onto landscaping beds, washing away mulch, soil, and plants. Over time, this creates erosion channels that are expensive to repair.

## What Does Gutter Cleaning Cost in Orlando?

Professional gutter cleaning in the Orlando area typically costs:

- **Single-story home:** $75 to $150
- **Two-story home:** $150 to $250
- **Large or complex rooflines:** $250 to $400

These prices generally include clearing all gutters and downspouts, flushing the system with water, and a basic inspection for damage or separation. Some companies charge extra for gutter guard removal and reinstallation.

Given that a single instance of fascia rot repair can cost ten times the price of a cleaning, the math is straightforward. Regular gutter maintenance is one of the highest-return investments you can make in your home.

## Should You Install Gutter Guards?

Gutter guards reduce the frequency of cleaning but do not eliminate it. In Florida, the fine debris — pollen, seed pods, pine needles — still gets through most guard systems and creates a compacted layer that is actually harder to clean than open gutters.

If you install guards, plan on cleaning at least twice a year instead of four times. Guards work best on homes with minimal tree coverage, which is uncommon in established Orlando neighborhoods.

## Do It Yourself or Hire a Professional?

Gutter cleaning is one of those tasks that seems simple until you are on a ladder in the Florida heat with wasps flying out of a downspout. For single-story homes with easy roof access, a confident homeowner can handle it with a sturdy ladder, gloves, a scoop, and a garden hose.

For two-story homes, I strongly recommend hiring a professional. Falls from ladders are one of the leading causes of home injury in the United States, and the cost savings of doing it yourself are not worth the risk.
