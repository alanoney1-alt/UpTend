        <h1>The Dr. Phillips Homeowner's Maintenance Schedule for 2026</h1>

        <p>
          Owning a home in Dr. Phillips is great until Florida reminds you that it doesn't care about your weekend plans. Between the humidity, the storms, and the year round growing season, there's always something that needs attention. The trick is staying ahead of it instead of reacting to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Phillips has its own personality when it comes to home maintenance. luxury pool homes and gated community estates are common here, and each comes with its own set of quirks. Most Dr. Phillips communities have active HOAs, especially in Bay Hill and gated sections. Expect architectural review for exterior changes, strict landscaping standards, and regular compliance inspections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a month by month schedule built specifically for Dr. Phillips homeowners. Not generic advice you could find anywhere. This is tuned to the homes, the soil, and the community standards right here.
        </p>

        <h2>January and February: The Planning Months</h2>
        <p>
          Florida winters are mild enough that you can actually get things done outside without melting. Walk your property with fresh eyes. Look for stucco cracks, faded paint, and landscaping that didn't make it through the cooler months. Schedule your annual termite inspection now. Florida's subterranean termites don't take winters off, and sandy soil with good drainage, but large lots mean more irrigation coverage needed is exactly what they like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check your irrigation system. Watering restrictions shift seasonally in this part of Central Florida, and getting your zones right before spring saves water and avoids fines. If your home is near Restaurant Row, you know how quickly things dry out once the rain stops.
        </p>

        <h2>March and April: Spring Reset</h2>
        <p>
          This is when Dr. Phillips starts heating up and everything grows aggressively. Get your St. Augustine, Bermuda on golf course lots grass its first fertilizer application by mid April. Lay fresh mulch in your beds. If you've been putting off pressure washing your driveway and walkways, now is the time. Algae and mold have been building all winter, and your HOA's spring walkthrough is probably right around the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your first gutter cleaning of the year. You want clean gutters before the daily afternoon thunderstorms start in late May. Bay Hill and Cypress Point residents, this applies double if you have mature oaks overhead.
        </p>

        <h2>May and June: Hurricane Prep Window</h2>
        <p>
          Hurricane season officially starts June 1, but smart Dr. Phillips homeowners start in May. Trim any tree branches within 10 feet of your roof. Check your storm shutters or impact windows for damage. Make sure your pool pump and exterior equipment are secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly every home here has a pool. Resort-style setups are common. Weekly service is non-negotiable in this climate. If you're not already on a weekly pool service schedule, June is when you'll wish you were. Rising temperatures and afternoon rain change water chemistry fast.
        </p>

        <h2>July and August: Storm Season Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Weekly lawn mowing is non negotiable during Florida summer. Your St. Augustine, Bermuda on golf course lots is growing inches per week, and a single missed mowing can trigger an HOA violation in communities like Bay Hill and Cypress Point. Keep your mower blade sharp and mow high. Cutting too short in summer heat will damage your lawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          After any significant storm, do a quick property walkthrough. Check for lifted roof shingles, damaged screen enclosures, and clogged downspouts. Document everything with photos. This matters for insurance claims if something bigger happens later in the season.
        </p>

        <h2>September and October: Post Storm Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          The worst of hurricane season wraps up by mid October. Even if Dr. Phillips dodged a direct hit, months of heavy rain take a toll. Check for standing water around your foundation, mold on exterior walls, and any soft spots in your fascia or soffit boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your second gutter cleaning of the year. Dr. Phillips's trees drop leaves heavily in fall, and one good rain with clogged gutters can push water into your walls. This is also a good time to have your roof inspected, especially if your home is more than 10 years old.
        </p>

        <h2>November and December: Deep Clean and Protect</h2>
        <p>
          Florida's dry season starts in November, making it the ideal time for exterior projects. Schedule a full house pressure wash to remove the summer's buildup of mold and dirt. Touch up exterior paint that's fading. If your driveway sealer is more than two years old, now is the time to reapply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, consider a deep clean of carpets, tile grout, and air ducts. Your AC has been running nonstop for six months and your ductwork is full of whatever Florida's air carried in. Dr. Phillips homes near Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts know this feeling well.
        </p>

        <h2>What Catches Dr. Phillips Homeowners Off Guard</h2>
        <p>
          A few things specific to this area: Sandy soil with good drainage, but large lots mean more irrigation coverage needed. That affects everything from foundation settling to how your pavers shift over time. Check walkways annually and relevel as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chinch bugs in large lawns, mosquitoes near Turkey Lake, rats in older attic spaces are the main pest concerns here. Regular pest control isn't optional. it's essential. And if you're in a newer Dr. Phillips home, remember that most builder warranties on cosmetic items like drywall cracks and grout separation expire after one or two years. Don't sit on those.
        </p>
