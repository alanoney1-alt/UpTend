        <h1>Just Moved to Lake Nona? Your Home's First 90 Days Checklist</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to Lake Nona. You've unpacked the boxes, figured out which light switch controls which fan, and
          maybe even found your favorite spot at Boxi Park. But there's a whole list of home related things that new
          Lake Nona residents don't realize they need to handle in the first few months. and some of them have
          deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you bought new construction in Laureate Park, a resale in Storey Park, or you're renting in one
          of the newer communities near Medical City, here's what your home needs from you in the first 90 days.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 1: The Essentials</h2>

        <h3>Set Up Your Utilities and Know Your Provider</h3>
        <p>
          Most Lake Nona homes are served by OUC (Orlando Utilities Commission) for electricity and water. If you
          haven't already, set up your account at ouc.com. Enable autopay and set up usage alerts. Florida summers
          will shock your electric bill if you're coming from up north, and it helps to see it coming.
        </p>

        <h3>Register with Your HOA</h3>
        <p>
          This is not optional. Most Lake Nona communities have mandatory HOAs, and they expect you to register
          within 30 days of closing. Laureate Park, for example, has specific architectural guidelines for everything
          from mailbox styles to the color of your front door. Get a copy of your community's CC&Rs (Covenants,
          Conditions, and Restrictions) and actually read them. Ignorance isn't a defense when the violation letter
          shows up.
        </p>

        <h3>Change Your Locks and Test Your Garage Code</h3>
        <p>
          Even on new construction. builders hand out access to dozens of subcontractors during the build process.
          Rekeying your locks costs $100 to $200 and takes about an hour. Reset your garage door opener code while
          you're at it.
        </p>

        <h2>Weeks 2 Through 4: Get Ahead of Florida</h2>

        <h3>Learn the Water Restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          Orange County enforces year round irrigation restrictions. You can only water on specific days based on
          your address (even addresses water on certain days, odd on others), and never between 10 AM and 4 PM.
          Violations carry fines, and your neighbors in Lake Nona will definitely notice if your sprinklers are
          running on the wrong day. Set your irrigation timer correctly from day one.
        </p>

        <h3>Schedule a Pest Inspection</h3>
        <p>
          Florida has bugs. Lake Nona, with its proximity to conservation areas and retention ponds, has more bugs
          than most Orlando neighborhoods. Get a pest control company out within your first month. You're looking for
          termites (subterranean termites love Florida's sandy soil), roaches (the big outdoor ones. they're
          called palmetto bugs here but let's be honest), and fire ants in your yard.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quarterly pest control plan typically runs $100 to $150 per quarter and is one of those expenses that
          pays for itself the first time you don't find a roach in your kitchen.
        </p>

        <h3>Inspect Your Roof and Gutters</h3>
        <p>
          Even on new construction, it's worth having a roofer do a quick inspection. Builders move fast, and minor
          installation issues are common. If you bought a resale, this is critical. get up there (or send someone up
          there) and check for lifted shingles, damaged flashing, and clogged gutters before your first Florida
          rainstorm teaches you what your gutters can't handle.
        </p>

        <h2>Month 2: Dial In Your Maintenance</h2>

        <h3>Set Up Lawn Care</h3>
        <p>
          St. Augustine is the dominant grass type in Lake Nona, and it needs consistent care. Weekly mowing during
          the growing season (March through October) and biweekly in winter. If you're doing it yourself, invest in
          a quality mower and learn the right cutting height. too short and Florida sun will scorch it. too tall and
          your HOA will send a letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're hiring out, expect $30 to $60 per visit for standard mowing and edging. Lock in a weekly service
          before summer hits. good lawn crews in Lake Nona book up fast.
        </p>

        <h3>Get Your Pool on a Schedule</h3>
        <p>
          If your home has a pool (and many Lake Nona homes do), you need a maintenance routine immediately. Florida
          heat and afternoon rain change your water chemistry constantly. Either learn to test and balance it yourself
          or hire a weekly pool service ($99 to $210 per month depending on pool size and service level).
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean your skimmer baskets weekly, run your pump 8 to 12 hours per day, and don't skip the monthly filter
          cleaning. A green pool in Lake Nona will get you an HOA violation faster than almost anything else.
        </p>

        <h3>Pressure Wash Everything</h3>
        <p>
          Your driveway, walkways, and patio probably already have the beginnings of algae growth, especially if the
          previous owner skipped a season. A thorough pressure wash now sets a clean baseline. Plan to do this twice
          a year going forward.
        </p>

        <h2>Month 3: Hurricane Prep and Long Term Planning</h2>

        <h3>Build Your Hurricane Kit</h3>
        <p>
          If you moved to Lake Nona between October and May, hurricane season (June through November) might feel
          abstract. It's not. Build your kit now: water (one gallon per person per day for at least three days),
          non perishable food, flashlights, batteries, a manual can opener, important documents in a waterproof bag,
          and a full charge on a portable power bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Know where your storm shutters are stored (if your home has them) and practice putting them up before you
          need to do it under pressure. If your home has impact windows instead, verify they're rated and know which
          ones aren't covered. most homes have a mix.
        </p>

        <h3>Find Your Pros Before You Need Them</h3>
        <p>
          The worst time to find a plumber, electrician, or handyman is when something breaks at 9 PM on a Saturday.
          Start building your list of trusted local service providers now. Ask your neighbors, check Lake Nona
          community groups, and save contacts for the services you'll definitely need: lawn care, pest control, pool
          service, and a reliable handyman for the inevitable list of small fixes.
        </p>

        <h3>Know Your Builder Warranty</h3>
        <p>
          If you bought new construction, your builder warranty is a ticking clock. Most cover cosmetic issues (nail
          pops, drywall cracks, minor settling) for only one year. Structural coverage typically lasts 10 years.
          Do a thorough walkthrough before your one year warranty expires and submit every issue you find. Builders
          expect this. don't feel bad about being thorough.
        </p>
