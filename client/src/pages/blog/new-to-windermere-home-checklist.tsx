        <h1>New to Windermere? Your First 90 Days Home Checklist</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to Windermere. You picked a great spot. But if you just moved here from somewhere that isn't Central Florida, there are a few things nobody tells you until it's too late. This isn't a generic "new homeowner" checklist. This is specific to Windermere and the stuff that actually matters in your first 90 days.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 1: The Essentials</h2>

        <h3>Utilities and Services</h3>
        <p>
          Get your utilities transferred or set up immediately. In Windermere, your electric provider is most likely Duke Energy or OUC depending on your exact location. Water and sewer service runs through the local utility authority. Don't forget to set up trash and recycling pickup, which varies by whether you're in the city limits or unincorporated county.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set your thermostat and leave it. Florida newcomers always make the mistake of setting it too low. Keep it at 76 to 78 during summer. Your electric bill will thank you, and your AC will last longer.
        </p>

        <h3>HOA Registration</h3>
        <p>
          Windermere communities like Isleworth and Keene's Pointe have some of the strictest HOA standards in Central Florida. Architectural review boards approve everything from mailbox styles to landscape lighting. If you're in a community with an HOA, register with the management company within your first week. Get a copy of the CC&Rs and read them. Seriously. The most common violations for new residents are parking, trash can visibility, and unapproved exterior changes. You don't want a fine letter before you've finished unpacking.
        </p>

        <h3>Change Your Address</h3>
        <p>
          USPS, DMV, voter registration, insurance. Do it all in week one while you're thinking about it. Florida requires you to update your driver's license within 30 days of establishing residency. The Windermere area has a few DMV locations, but expect a wait. Book an appointment online if you can.
        </p>

        <h2>Weeks 2 through 4: Home Setup</h2>

        <h3>Pest Control</h3>
        <p>
          This is not optional in Florida. Get a pest control service set up within your first month. Lake-proximity mosquitoes, mole crickets in large lawns, wildlife intrusion from conservation areas are the primary concerns in Windermere. A quarterly service plan costs far less than dealing with an infestation. Your termite bond from the home purchase should be active, but verify it and understand what it covers.
        </p>

        <h3>Lawn Care</h3>
        <p>
          Windermere lawns are primarily St. Augustine, Zoysia, and professionally maintained turf on estate lawns. If you've never maintained Florida grass before, here's what you need to know: it grows year round, it needs regular fertilization (but there are county rules about when and what you can apply), and mowing height matters. Set your mower to 3.5 to 4 inches for St. Augustine and never cut more than one third of the blade height at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're in Isleworth or Keene's Pointe, your neighbors are already on top of their lawns. Don't be the house that brings down the street. Get a lawn service or commit to weekly mowing from March through October.
        </p>

        <h3>Irrigation System</h3>
        <p>
          Most Windermere homes have in ground irrigation. Learn your system, know where your controller is, and set it according to local watering restrictions. Overwatering is just as bad as underwatering in Florida. It promotes fungal growth and wastes money. Two to three days per week, early morning, is usually the right cadence.
        </p>

        <h3>Pool Care</h3>
        <p>
          Large, custom pools are the norm. Many have water features, spas, and advanced automation systems. If your new home has a pool, get a professional pool service lined up within your first two weeks. Florida pools need weekly chemical balancing, skimming, and filter maintenance. The water chemistry changes fast here, especially in summer when daily rain dilutes your chemicals and heat breeds algae.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask the previous owner or your home inspector about the age of the pool pump, filter, and heater if applicable. Equipment older than 8 to 10 years may be on borrowed time.
        </p>

        <h2>Days 30 through 60: Getting Settled</h2>

        <h3>Find Your Local Spots</h3>
        <p>
          Windermere has character. Get to know it. Butler Chain of Lakes is worth a visit if you haven't been yet. Isleworth Golf & Country Club is another local favorite. Talk to your neighbors. The people who've been here a while know which contractors are good, which restaurants are overrated, and where to find the best local services.
        </p>

        <h3>Hurricane Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          If you moved here outside of hurricane season (June through November), you might not be thinking about this yet. Start now anyway. Know where your shutters are stored or whether your windows are impact rated. Identify a safe room in your home. Stock a basic kit: water, flashlights, batteries, a battery powered radio, and important documents in a waterproof container.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figure out your evacuation zone. Windermere falls in specific zones that determine whether you'd need to leave during a major storm. Your county's emergency management website has maps.
        </p>

        <h3>Home Insurance Review</h3>
        <p>
          Florida home insurance is its own world. Review your policy carefully. Make sure you understand your wind/hurricane deductible (it's separate from your regular deductible and usually a percentage of your home's value). Flood insurance is separate from homeowner's insurance and may be required depending on your location in Windermere.
        </p>

        <h2>Days 60 through 90: Long Term Planning</h2>

        <h3>Build Your Vendor List</h3>
        <p>
          In the next few months, you're going to need a plumber, an electrician, an AC technician, and probably a handyman. Don't wait until something breaks to find one. Ask neighbors for recommendations, check reviews, and have at least two reliable contacts for each trade. When your AC dies on a 95 degree Saturday in July, you'll be glad you did this homework.
        </p>

        <h3>Schedule a Home Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          Your home inspection before purchase was a snapshot. Now that you're living in the house, you'll notice things the inspector didn't mention. This is a good time to walk through with a fresh set of eyes and create a prioritized list of what needs attention now versus what can wait.
