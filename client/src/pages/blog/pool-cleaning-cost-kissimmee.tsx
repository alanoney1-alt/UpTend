        <h1>How Much Does Pool Cleaning Cost in Kissimmee? (2026 Guide)</h1>

        <p>
          If you own a pool in Kissimmee, you already know it needs regular attention. But figuring out what pool cleaning should actually cost around here? That's where it gets murky. Let's clear it up with real numbers from the Kissimmee market in 2026.
        </p>

        <h2>Kissimmee Pool Cleaning Prices: The Real Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          These are typical ranges for residential pool cleaning services in Kissimmee as of early 2026:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic weekly service (chemicals + skim):</strong> $85 to $120 per month</li>
          <li><strong>Standard weekly (chemicals, skim, vacuum, brush):</strong> $140 to $185 per month</li>
          <li><strong>Full service weekly (everything + filter + equipment checks):</strong> $185 to $250 per month</li>
          <li><strong>One time deep clean (green pool recovery):</strong> $225 to $400</li>
          <li><strong>Filter deep clean (one time):</strong> $75 to $150</li>
          <li><strong>Pool acid wash:</strong> $350 to $600</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Kissimmee's pool market skews toward the higher end because many pools here are larger and more feature rich than average.
        </p>

        <h2>What Affects Your Pool Cleaning Cost</h2>

        <h3>Pool Size and Features</h3>
        <p>
          A standard residential pool is one price. Add a spa, water features, a saltwater system, or a pool heater, and the service complexity goes up. Vacation rental pools need extra attention. Guests leave them in rough shape, and quick turnaround cleaning is essential between bookings.
        </p>

        <h3>Screened vs. Unscreened</h3>
        <p>
          Screened pools (which are common in Kissimmee) generally stay cleaner and need slightly less chemical treatment. Unscreened pools collect more debris, deal with more rain dilution, and usually cost a bit more to maintain.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Condition</h3>
        <p>
          If your pool has been neglected, expect to pay for a one time deep clean or green pool recovery before starting regular service. A pool that's already well maintained is straightforward. One that's been sitting for months needs work to bring back.
        </p>

        <h3>Service Frequency</h3>
        <p>
          Weekly service is the standard in Florida and it's what we recommend. Some companies offer bi weekly, but in Kissimmee's climate, two weeks is too long between visits. Algae can take hold in days during summer, and rain constantly throws off your water chemistry.
        </p>

        <h2>When Pool Service Matters Most in Kissimmee</h2>
        <p>
          Florida pool care is year round, but the intensity shifts with the seasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>March through May:</strong> Temperatures rise and algae season begins. This is when consistent weekly service becomes critical.</li>
          <li><strong>June through September:</strong> Peak season. Daily afternoon storms dump rain into your pool, diluting chemicals and introducing contaminants. Your pool tech is earning their pay during these months.</li>
          <li><strong>October through February:</strong> Lower maintenance period but not zero. Chemical demand drops but debris increases with fall leaves. Equipment should still be monitored.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Pool Service</h2>
        <p>
          You can maintain your own pool. Plenty of Kissimmee homeowners do. But it means testing water chemistry two to three times per week, adjusting chemicals, skimming, vacuuming, cleaning filters, and monitoring equipment. In summer, this can easily take two to three hours per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The math usually works out close. DIY chemicals and supplies run $50 to $80 per month, plus your time. A basic professional service starts around $85 to $120 per month and handles everything. Most homeowners who try DIY for a summer end up hiring a service.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Choose a Pool Service in Kissimmee</h2>
        <p>
          Look for a service that's licensed, insured, and willing to provide references from other Kissimmee clients. Ask what's included in each visit. "Pool cleaning" can mean very different things depending on the company. At minimum, every weekly visit should include chemical testing and balancing, surface skimming, brushing, and basket cleaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be cautious of services priced far below market. A $60 per month "pool service" usually means a quick skim and chemical dump with no real maintenance.
        </p>
