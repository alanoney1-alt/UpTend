        <h1>How Much Does Pressure Washing Cost in Clermont? (2026 Guide)</h1>

        <p>
          Searching "pressure washing cost Clermont" and getting national averages that don't apply here? Let's fix that. Here's what Clermont homeowners are actually paying for pressure washing in 2026, what affects the price, and how to know you're getting a fair deal.
        </p>

        <h2>Clermont Pressure Washing Prices: Real Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          These are typical ranges for residential pressure washing in the Clermont area as of early 2026:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Driveway (2 car):</strong> $99 to $175</li>
          <li><strong>Driveway (3 car or oversized):</strong> $150 to $250</li>
          <li><strong>Full house exterior (single story):</strong> $200 to $350</li>
          <li><strong>Full house exterior (two story):</strong> $300 to $500</li>
          <li><strong>Pool deck and patio:</strong> $100 to $200</li>
          <li><strong>Sidewalks and walkways:</strong> $50 to $100</li>
          <li><strong>Fence (vinyl or wood):</strong> $150 to $300</li>
          <li><strong>Roof soft wash:</strong> $250 to $500</li>
          <li><strong>Full property bundle (driveway + house + walkways):</strong> $350 to $600</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Clermont's hilltop homes with elevation views often land in the mid to upper range because of larger surface areas and more detailed exterior finishes.
        </p>

        <h2>What Affects the Price in Clermont</h2>

        <h3>Square Footage</h3>
        <p>
          The biggest factor. Most pros price by the square foot for large surfaces. Clermont properties range from modest to expansive, so quotes will vary significantly based on your home's footprint and driveway size.
        </p>

        <h3>Surface Type and Condition</h3>
        <p>
          Concrete driveways are straightforward. Pavers take more time. Stucco exteriors require soft washing at lower pressure with chemical treatment. Clermont homes that haven't been cleaned in two or more years will cost 10 to 20 percent more because the buildup takes extra passes.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility and Terrain</h3>
        <p>
          Two story homes cost more because they require extension equipment. Gated communities may require advance scheduling and access coordination.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Time to Pressure Wash in Clermont</h2>
        <p>
          Florida's humidity means mold, mildew, and algae build up year round. Most Clermont homeowners should pressure wash at least twice a year:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring (March or April):</strong> Clear winter buildup before rainy season. This is also when most HOAs do property inspections.</li>
          <li><strong>Fall (October or November):</strong> Remove summer's algae and storm debris. Dry season means surfaces stay cleaner longer after washing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Pro</h2>
        <p>
          Renting a pressure washer costs $50 to $80 per day. But rental units are consumer grade and lack the PSI and flow rate for heavy buildup. What takes a pro 90 minutes will take you most of a Saturday. And incorrect pressure on stucco or painted surfaces can cause real damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Factor in rental cost, your time, cleaning solution, and the risk of damaging something, and the math usually favors hiring a professional. Especially when a standard driveway wash starts under $150.
