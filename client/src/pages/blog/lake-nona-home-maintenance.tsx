        <h1>The Lake Nona Homeowner's Maintenance Schedule You Didn't Know You Needed</h1>

        <p>
          If you own a home in Lake Nona, you already know the basics: mow the lawn, clean the pool, keep the HOA
          happy. But Florida's climate has a way of sneaking up on you. One missed gutter cleaning before hurricane
          season and suddenly you're dealing with water damage that costs more than the home inspection did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Lake Nona homes are less than 10 years old. That's great news for your roof and your appliances, but
          it also means you're in the window where small things start showing up. Nail pops in the drywall. Caulking
          pulling away from window frames. Settling cracks in the garage floor. None of it is alarming on its own, but
          left alone, these little things compound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a month by month schedule built specifically for Lake Nona homeowners. Not a generic "homeowner tips"
          list. this is tuned to our climate, our soil, and our community standards.
        </p>

        <h2>January and February: The Planning Months</h2>
        <p>
          Florida winters are mild, which makes this the perfect time to walk your property with fresh eyes. Look for
          stucco cracks, faded exterior paint, and any landscaping that didn't survive the cooler months. This is also
          when you should schedule your annual termite inspection. Florida's subterranean termites don't take winters
          off, and Lake Nona's sandy soil is exactly what they love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check your irrigation system now too. Orange County's watering restrictions shift seasonally, and getting
          your zones dialed in before spring saves water and avoids fines.
        </p>

        <h2>March and April: Spring Reset</h2>
        <p>
          This is when Lake Nona starts heating up and everything grows aggressively. Get your St. Augustine grass its
          first fertilizer application by mid April. Lay fresh mulch in your beds. If you've been putting off pressure
          washing your driveway and walkways, now is the time. Algae and mold have been building all winter, and your
          HOA's spring walkthrough is probably right around the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your first gutter cleaning of the year. You want clean gutters before the daily afternoon
          thunderstorms start in late May.
        </p>

        <h2>May and June: Hurricane Prep Window</h2>
        <p>
          Hurricane season officially starts June 1, but smart Lake Nona homeowners start preparing in May. Trim any
          tree branches within 10 feet of your roof. Check your storm shutters or impact windows for damage. Make sure
          your pool pump and exterior equipment are secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also when your pool needs the most attention. Rising temperatures and afternoon rain change your
          water chemistry fast. If you're not already on a weekly pool service schedule, June is when you'll wish you
          were.
        </p>

        <h2>July and August: Storm Season Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Weekly lawn mowing is non negotiable during Florida summer. Your grass is growing inches per week, and a
          single missed mowing can trigger an HOA violation in communities like Laureate Park and Storey Park. Keep
          your mower blade sharp and mow high. cutting St. Augustine too short in summer heat will kill it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After any significant storm, do a quick property walkthrough. Check for lifted roof shingles, damaged screen
          enclosures, and clogged downspouts. Document everything with photos. this matters for insurance claims if
          something bigger happens later in the season.
        </p>

        <h2>September and October: Post Storm Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          The worst of hurricane season wraps up by mid October, and this is when you assess the damage. Even if you
          dodged a direct hit, months of heavy rain take a toll. Check for standing water around your foundation,
          mold on exterior walls, and any soft spots in your fascia or soffit boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your second gutter cleaning of the year. Oak trees in Lake Nona drop leaves heavily in fall, and
          one good rain with clogged gutters can push water into your walls.
        </p>

        <h2>November and December: Deep Clean and Protect</h2>
        <p>
          Florida's dry season starts in November, and this is the ideal time for exterior projects. Schedule a full
          house pressure wash to remove the summer's buildup of mold and dirt. Touch up any exterior paint that's
          fading. If your driveway sealer is more than two years old, this is the time to reapply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, consider a deep clean of carpets, tile grout, and air ducts. Your AC has been running nonstop for
          six months and your ductwork is full of whatever Florida's air carried in.
        </p>

        <h2>The Stuff Nobody Tells You About Lake Nona</h2>
        <p>
          A few things that catch new Lake Nona homeowners off guard: the sandy Florida soil means your pavers and
          walkways shift more than you'd expect. Check them annually and relevel as needed. Most builder warranties
          on new construction cover structural issues for 10 years, but cosmetic items like drywall cracks and grout
          separation often expire after one or two years. Don't wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if your home backs up to a conservation area or retention pond, expect more pest activity than your
          neighbors on interior lots. Regular pest control isn't optional here. it's essential.
        </p>

        <h2>A Better Way to Stay on Top of It</h2>
        <p>
          We're building something different in Orlando. At <Link href="/">UpTend</Link>, we're putting together a
          platform that helps Lake Nona homeowners stay ahead of maintenance instead of reacting to problems. We're
          still in early access, but we're already helping homeowners in the area get connected with trusted local
          pros and build real maintenance plans for their homes.
