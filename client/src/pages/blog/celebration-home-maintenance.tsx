        <h1>The Celebration Homeowner's Maintenance Schedule for 2026</h1>

        <p>
          Owning a home in Celebration is great until Florida reminds you that it doesn't care about your weekend plans. Between the humidity, the storms, and the year round growing season, there's always something that needs attention. The trick is staying ahead of it instead of reacting to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Celebration has its own personality when it comes to home maintenance. neo-traditional homes and Victorian-style townhomes are common here, and each comes with its own set of quirks. Celebration's architectural review board is legendary. Originally established by Disney, the standards cover paint colors, landscaping, holiday decorations, mailboxes, and even window treatments visible from the street.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a month by month schedule built specifically for Celebration homeowners. Not generic advice you could find anywhere. This is tuned to the homes, the soil, and the community standards right here.
        </p>

        <h2>January and February: The Planning Months</h2>
        <p>
          Florida winters are mild enough that you can actually get things done outside without melting. Walk your property with fresh eyes. Look for stucco cracks, faded paint, and landscaping that didn't make it through the cooler months. Schedule your annual termite inspection now. Florida's subterranean termites don't take winters off, and low-lying former marshland, prone to standing water after heavy rains is exactly what they like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check your irrigation system. Watering restrictions shift seasonally in this part of Central Florida, and getting your zones right before spring saves water and avoids fines. If your home is near Celebration Town Center, you know how quickly things dry out once the rain stops.
        </p>

        <h2>March and April: Spring Reset</h2>
        <p>
          This is when Celebration starts heating up and everything grows aggressively. Get your St. Augustine with strict HOA height and appearance requirements grass its first fertilizer application by mid April. Lay fresh mulch in your beds. If you've been putting off pressure washing your driveway and walkways, now is the time. Algae and mold have been building all winter, and curb appeal matters when neighbors are doing the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your first gutter cleaning of the year. You want clean gutters before the daily afternoon thunderstorms start in late May. North Village and South Village residents, this applies double if you have mature oaks overhead.
        </p>

        <h2>May and June: Hurricane Prep Window</h2>
        <p>
          Hurricane season officially starts June 1, but smart Celebration homeowners start in May. Trim any tree branches within 10 feet of your roof. Check your storm shutters or impact windows for damage. Make sure your pool pump and exterior equipment are secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pools vary by village. Screened enclosures are standard. Community pools supplement many homes. If you're not already on a weekly pool service schedule, June is when you'll wish you were. Rising temperatures and afternoon rain change water chemistry fast.
        </p>

        <h2>July and August: Storm Season Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          Weekly lawn mowing is non negotiable during Florida summer. Your St. Augustine with strict HOA height and appearance requirements is growing inches per week, and a single missed mowing can trigger complaints from neighbors in communities like North Village and South Village. Keep your mower blade sharp and mow high. Cutting too short in summer heat will damage your lawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          After any significant storm, do a quick property walkthrough. Check for lifted roof shingles, damaged screen enclosures, and clogged downspouts. Document everything with photos. This matters for insurance claims if something bigger happens later in the season.
        </p>

        <h2>September and October: Post Storm Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          The worst of hurricane season wraps up by mid October. Even if Celebration dodged a direct hit, months of heavy rain take a toll. Check for standing water around your foundation, mold on exterior walls, and any soft spots in your fascia or soffit boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schedule your second gutter cleaning of the year. Celebration's trees drop leaves heavily in fall, and one good rain with clogged gutters can push water into your walls. This is also a good time to have your roof inspected, especially if your home is more than 10 years old.
        </p>

        <h2>November and December: Deep Clean and Protect</h2>
        <p>
          Florida's dry season starts in November, making it the ideal time for exterior projects. Schedule a full house pressure wash to remove the summer's buildup of mold and dirt. Touch up exterior paint that's fading. If your driveway sealer is more than two years old, now is the time to reapply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, consider a deep clean of carpets, tile grout, and air ducts. Your AC has been running nonstop for six months and your ductwork is full of whatever Florida's air carried in. Celebration homes near Celebration Golf Club know this feeling well.
        </p>

        <h2>What Catches Celebration Homeowners Off Guard</h2>
        <p>
          A few things specific to this area: Low-lying former marshland, prone to standing water after heavy rains. That affects everything from foundation settling to how your pavers shift over time. Check walkways annually and relevel as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mosquitoes (low elevation near wetlands), love bugs seasonally, fire ants are the main pest concerns here. Regular pest control isn't optional. it's essential. And if you're in a newer Celebration home, remember that most builder warranties on cosmetic items like drywall cracks and grout separation expire after one or two years. Don't sit on those.
        </p>
