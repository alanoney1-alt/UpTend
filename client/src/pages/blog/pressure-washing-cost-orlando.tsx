        <h1>How Much Does Pressure Washing Actually Cost in Orlando? (2026 Guide)</h1>

        <p>
          You search "pressure washing cost Orlando" and get a dozen results that all say the same thing: "it depends."
          Helpful, right? Let's skip the runaround and talk real numbers based on what Orlando homeowners are actually
          paying in 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've seen hundreds of pressure washing quotes come through our platform. Here's what the market actually
          looks like, what drives the price up or down, and how to know if you're getting a fair deal.
        </p>

        <h2>Orlando Pressure Washing Prices: The Real Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          These are typical ranges for residential pressure washing in the Orlando metro area as of early 2026. Prices
          include labor, equipment, and standard cleaning solutions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Driveway (2 car):</strong> $99 to $175</li>
          <li><strong>Driveway (3 car or oversized):</strong> $150 to $250</li>
          <li><strong>Full house exterior (single story):</strong> $200 to $350</li>
          <li><strong>Full house exterior (two story):</strong> $300 to $500</li>
          <li><strong>Pool deck and patio:</strong> $100 to $200</li>
          <li><strong>Sidewalks and walkways:</strong> $50 to $100</li>
          <li><strong>Fence (vinyl or wood):</strong> $150 to $300</li>
          <li><strong>Roof soft wash:</strong> $250 to $500</li>
          <li><strong>Full property bundle (driveway + house + walkways):</strong> $350 to $600</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On UpTend, our pressure washing pros typically come in at the lower to mid range of these numbers because
          we cut out the middleman markup. A standard driveway wash through our platform starts around $99.
        </p>

        <h2>What Actually Affects the Price</h2>
        <p>
          Not all pressure washing jobs are equal. Here's what moves the needle on your quote:
        </p>

        <h3>Square Footage</h3>
        <p>
          This is the biggest factor. Most pros price by the square foot for large surfaces and by the job for
          smaller ones. A 600 square foot driveway costs less than a 1,200 square foot one. Simple math, but worth
          mentioning because some companies charge flat rates that quietly overcharge smaller homes.
        </p>

        <h3>Surface Type and Condition</h3>
        <p>
          Concrete driveways are straightforward. Pavers take more time because the pro needs to work around the
          joints. Stucco exteriors require soft washing (lower pressure, chemical treatment) instead of straight
          high pressure, which takes longer. If your surfaces haven't been cleaned in two or more years, expect to
          pay 10 to 20 percent more because the buildup takes extra passes to remove.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          Two story homes cost more because they require extension equipment or lifts. If your driveway is gated or
          your backyard pool deck has limited access, that adds time and sometimes cost.
        </p>

        <h3>Add On Treatments</h3>
        <p>
          Some pros offer sealant application after pressure washing your driveway or patio. This extends the life
          of the cleaning and protects against Florida's UV damage, but it adds $100 to $300 depending on the area.
          Worth it for pavers. Optional for standard concrete.
        </p>

        <h2>When Should You Pressure Wash in Orlando?</h2>
        <p>
          Florida's humidity means mold, mildew, and algae grow year round on exterior surfaces. Most Orlando
          homeowners should pressure wash at least twice a year. Here's the ideal timing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Spring (March or April):</strong> Clean off winter buildup before the rainy season. This is also
            when most HOAs do their annual property inspections, so getting ahead of it avoids violation letters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fall (October or November):</strong> Remove the summer's worth of algae, mold, and storm debris.
            The dry season means your surfaces stay cleaner longer after washing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you're only doing it once a year, go with spring. Getting your home clean before six months of daily
          thunderstorms makes the biggest visual difference.
        </p>

        <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Pro</h2>
        <p>
          You can rent a pressure washer from Home Depot for about $50 to $80 per day. So why pay someone else?
        </p>
        <p>
          A few reasons. First, most rental units are consumer grade. they don't have the PSI or flow rate to handle
          heavy algae or large surfaces efficiently. What takes a pro 90 minutes will take you most of a Saturday.
          Second, pressure washing your house exterior incorrectly can force water behind siding, strip paint, or
          damage window seals. Pros know the right pressure settings and angles for each surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, and this is the one people forget: you still need to buy cleaning solution, you'll burn through gas
          or deal with electric cord management, and you'll spend time picking up and returning the rental. By the time
          you factor in the rental cost, your time, and the risk of damaging something, the math usually favors
          hiring someone. especially when a standard driveway wash starts under $100.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Avoid Overpaying</h2>
        <p>
          Get at least two quotes. Avoid companies that only quote by phone without seeing your property. ask for a
          photo based quote at minimum. Be skeptical of prices that seem too low. a $49 whole house pressure wash
          likely means cut corners, weak equipment, or surprise upcharges on site.
        </p>
        <p>
          And always confirm what's included. "Full exterior" should mean all walls, the driveway, walkways, and the
          front porch at minimum. Some companies break each surface into a separate line item to inflate the total.
        </p>
