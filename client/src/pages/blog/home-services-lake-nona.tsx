        <h1>Home Services in Lake Nona: The Complete Guide for Homeowners</h1>

        <p>
          Lake Nona is one of the fastest-growing communities in Central Florida — and with that growth comes a unique
          set of home maintenance challenges. Whether you just moved into a new build in Laureate Park or you've been
          in the area since before the Medical City boom, keeping your home in top shape requires knowing what needs
          attention, when, and who to trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide breaks down the essential <strong>home services</strong> every <strong>Lake Nona</strong> homeowner
          should have on their radar, with practical tips specific to our corner of Orlando.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Lake Nona Homes Need Special Attention</h2>
        <p>
          Lake Nona isn't your typical Orlando neighborhood. The combination of newer construction, Florida's
          subtropical climate, and the community's high standards (hello, HOA) means your home maintenance checklist
          looks a little different than it would up north.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Here's what makes Lake Nona unique:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>New construction settling.</strong> Many homes in Lake Nona are under 10 years old. That means
            drywall cracks, nail pops, and minor foundation settling are normal — but they still need to be addressed
            before they become bigger problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Florida humidity and storms.</strong> Orlando averages 54 inches of rain per year, most of it
            between June and September. That means clogged gutters, mold-prone exteriors, and landscaping that grows
            faster than you can keep up with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HOA standards.</strong> Most Lake Nona communities have active HOAs with strict exterior maintenance
            requirements. Falling behind on pressure washing, lawn care, or exterior paint can mean violation letters —
            and fines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Premium property values.</strong> With median home prices in Lake Nona well above the Orlando
            average, maintaining your home isn't just about comfort — it's about protecting your investment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Essential Home Services Every Lake Nona Homeowner Needs</h2>
        <p>
          Not every service needs to happen every month, but here's a seasonal breakdown of what to keep on your
          calendar.
        </p>

        <h3>Spring (March–May): Prep for Hurricane Season</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gutter cleaning and inspection.</strong> Florida's rainy season starts in June, and clogged gutters
            cause more water damage than most homeowners realize. For a typical Lake Nona home, expect to pay $150–$250
            for a thorough cleaning. Do this twice a year minimum.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pressure washing.</strong> Florida humidity breeds mold and algae on driveways, sidewalks, and home
            exteriors faster than anywhere else. A full exterior pressure wash in spring keeps your home looking sharp
            and your HOA happy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Landscaping reset.</strong> Spring is the best time to lay new sod, mulch beds, and trim back
            anything that got overgrown during winter. St. Augustine grass (the standard in most Lake Nona yards) needs
            its first fertilizer application around April.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pool service check.</strong> If you have a pool — and many Lake Nona homes do — spring is the time
            to ensure your pump, filter, and chemical balance are ready for heavy summer use.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summer (June–August): Storm Season Maintenance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Regular lawn care.</strong> Grass grows aggressively in Florida summer. Weekly mowing is
            non-negotiable unless you want a violation notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AC maintenance.</strong> Not technically a "home service" in the traditional sense, but your HVAC
            system is working overtime June through September. Get it serviced before it breaks during a 95-degree
            week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-storm cleanup.</strong> After any significant storm, inspect your property for downed branches,
            damaged screens, and clogged drainage. Having a reliable junk removal service on speed dial saves you time
            and back pain.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fall (September–November): Recovery and Deep Clean</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Deep home cleaning.</strong> After a summer of tracking sand, pool water, and Florida mud through
            your house, fall is the ideal time for a deep clean — especially carpets and tile grout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exterior inspection.</strong> Check for storm damage you may have missed: loose soffit panels,
            cracked stucco, damaged fence sections. A good handyman can knock out a list of small repairs in a single
            visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second gutter cleaning.</strong> Leaves from oak and cypress trees clog gutters fast in fall. Don't
            skip this one.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Winter (December–February): Planning Season</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Home audit.</strong> Winter is the best time to walk your property with a critical eye. What needs
            replacing? What's wearing out? Making a list now means you can schedule work during the slower season when
            pros have more availability and sometimes better pricing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interior projects.</strong> Painting, cabinet touch-ups, fixture replacements — anything indoors is
            best tackled when you're not competing with Florida's outdoor maintenance demands.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Find Reliable Home Service Pros in Lake Nona</h2>
        <p>
          Finding trustworthy service providers in a growing area like Lake Nona can be hit or miss. Here's what
          experienced homeowners in the area recommend:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Check the Lake Nona community groups.</strong> Facebook groups and Nextdoor are goldmines for real
            recommendations from actual neighbors. Look for names that come up repeatedly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify licensing and insurance.</strong> Florida requires licensing for many trades. Ask for proof
            before anyone starts work on your home. This protects you if something goes wrong.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get at least two quotes.</strong> Pricing varies wildly in Orlando. A simple pressure wash can range
            from $150 to $500 depending on the company. Don't overpay, but don't automatically go with the cheapest
            option either.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Look for bundled services.</strong> Some platforms let you book multiple services through one
            provider — junk removal, pressure washing, gutter cleaning, and more in one place. This saves time and
            often money compared to hiring separate companies for each task.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Lake Nona Home Services Typically Cost</h2>
        <p>Here's a rough guide to help you budget (prices as of early 2026, Orlando metro area):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lawn care (weekly mowing):</strong> $30–$60/visit</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure washing (full exterior):</strong> $200–$450</li>
          <li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> $129–$250</li>
          <li><strong>Pool cleaning (monthly service):</strong> $99–$210/month</li>
          <li><strong>Junk removal (single load):</strong> $99–$400</li>
          <li><strong>Handyman (general repairs):</strong> $75–$125/hour</li>
          <li><strong>Deep home cleaning:</strong> $200–$400</li>
          <li><strong>Landscaping (design + install):</strong> $1,500–$5,000+</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Prices tend to be slightly higher in Lake Nona compared to other Orlando neighborhoods due to the area's
          newer homes, larger lot sizes, and higher demand.
        </p>

        <h2>Keep Your Lake Nona Home in Top Shape</h2>
        <p>
          The key to home maintenance isn't doing everything at once — it's having a plan and sticking to it. Set
          calendar reminders for seasonal tasks, build relationships with reliable pros, and don't let small problems
          become expensive ones.
        </p>
