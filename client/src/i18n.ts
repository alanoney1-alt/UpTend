      "about.story_p1": "I still remember the moment everything clicked. I was helping a friend move out of his apartment—he'd hired a junk removal company to clear out his garage. The Pro who showed up was incredible: careful, professional, genuinely cared about doing good work. But when it came time to settle up, the price was double what my friend expected. No itemized breakdown. No proof of where anything went. Just a bill and a \"trust me.\"",
      "about.story_p2": "My friend lost part of his security deposit because there was no documentation. The Pro got squeezed by his platform, barely making minimum wage after fees. And all that \"junk\"? Nobody knew if it was recycled, donated, or just dumped in a landfill.",
      "about.story_p3": "Everybody lost. And I couldn't stop thinking about it.",
      "about.story_p4": "That's when I realized: your home is your biggest asset, but it has the worst paper trail. There's no Carfax for houses. No verified service history. Homeowners can't prove what they've maintained, renters can't protect themselves from bogus charges, and Pros—the people actually doing the work—get treated like disposable labor.",
      "about.story_p5": "So I built UpTend. Not as another app. As a different system entirely—one built on verifiable truth, not trust-me promises. A system where every job creates a record, every Pro builds a real reputation, and every customer gets proof of what actually happened.",

      "about.story_p1": "Todavía recuerdo el momento en que todo hizo clic. Estaba ayudando a un amigo a mudarse de su apartamento — había contratado una empresa de remoción de basura para limpiar su garaje. El Pro que llegó era increíble: cuidadoso, profesional, realmente le importaba hacer un buen trabajo. Pero cuando llegó la hora de pagar, el precio era el doble de lo que mi amigo esperaba. Sin desglose detallado. Sin prueba de adónde fue nada. Solo una factura y un \"confía en mí.\"",
      "about.story_p2": "Mi amigo perdió parte de su depósito de seguridad porque no había documentación. El Pro fue exprimido por su plataforma, apenas ganando el salario mínimo después de las comisiones. ¿Y toda esa \"basura\"? Nadie sabía si fue reciclada, donada o simplemente tirada en un vertedero.",
      "about.story_p3": "Todos perdieron. Y no podía dejar de pensar en ello.",
      "about.story_p4": "Fue entonces cuando me di cuenta: tu hogar es tu mayor activo, pero tiene el peor historial de documentación. No hay un Carfax para casas. Sin historial de servicio verificado. Los propietarios no pueden probar lo que han mantenido, los inquilinos no pueden protegerse de cargos falsos, y los Pros — las personas que realmente hacen el trabajo — son tratados como mano de obra desechable.",
      "about.story_p5": "Así que construí UpTend. No como otra app. Como un sistema completamente diferente — uno construido sobre verdad verificable, no promesas de \"confía en mí\". Un sistema donde cada trabajo crea un registro, cada Pro construye una reputación real, y cada cliente obtiene prueba de lo que realmente sucedió.",

Recibiendo una reseña de una estrella porque los precios de la plataforma eran engañosos. Eso es basura. Te conectamos directamente con <strong>Pros Verificados</strong> que cobran al instante y se quedan con más de lo que ganan. Sin comisiones por referencia. Sin \"cargos de plataforma\" misteriosos.
