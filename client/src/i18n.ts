      // Customers FAQ
      "faq.customers.q1": "How does UpTend work?",
      "faq.customers.a1": "It's simple! 1) Take photos of items or select from our item list, 2) Get an instant price quote, 3) Choose your pickup time, 4) A verified Pro arrives and hauls everything away. You can track their arrival in real-time and pay securely through the app.",
      "faq.customers.q2": "What items can you pick up?",
      "faq.customers.a2": "We can haul most household items including furniture, appliances, electronics, yard waste, construction debris, and general junk. We cannot accept hazardous materials (chemicals, paint, asbestos), medical waste, or extremely heavy items (hot tubs, pianos over 500 lbs) without special arrangements.",
      "faq.customers.q3": "How soon can you pick up my items?",
      "faq.customers.a3": "We offer same-day pickup in most areas! When you book, you'll see available time slots. Many customers get pickups within 2-4 hours during peak times. Weekend and evening slots are available.",
      "faq.customers.q4": "Do I need to be home for the pickup?",
      "faq.customers.a4": "Yes, someone 18 or older should be present to show the Pro which items to take and to verify the final price. If items are outside and easily accessible, you can arrange a contactless pickup by noting this in your booking.",
      "faq.customers.q5": "What if there are more items than I listed?",
      "faq.customers.a5": "Our Pros verify items on arrival. If there are additional items, you'll be notified of the adjusted price and must approve it before the job starts. We believe in transparent pricing — no surprise charges after the fact.",
      "faq.customers.q6": "What is the Home DNA Scan and how does it work?",
      "faq.customers.a6": "The Home DNA Scan is our free comprehensive home scan service. A certified inspector conducts a room-by-room walkthrough documenting your home's condition with photos and detailed notes. The Aerial tier includes drone footage for roof, gutters, and property perimeter. You receive a digital report perfect for insurance, pre-sale documentation, or rental property management. Complete yours and get a $25 credit toward your next booking.",
      "faq.customers.q7": "Can I cancel or reschedule my service?",
      "faq.customers.a7": "Yes! Cancel or reschedule free of charge up to 2 hours before your scheduled time. Cancellations within 2 hours of service incur a $25 fee. Same-day reschedules are subject to availability. You can manage bookings directly in the app.",
      "faq.customers.q8": "What happens if it rains on my scheduled service day?",
      "faq.customers.a8": "For outdoor services (landscaping, pressure washing, gutter cleaning), we monitor weather and will proactively contact you if conditions are unsafe. You can reschedule at no charge for weather-related issues. Indoor services proceed as scheduled regardless of weather.",
      "faq.customers.q9": "Do you offer recurring services?",
      "faq.customers.a9": "Absolutely! Set up weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly recurring services for landscaping, home cleaning, pool maintenance, and more. Recurring customers receive priority scheduling and discounted rates (5-15% off depending on frequency). Manage your recurring schedule anytime in the app.",
      "faq.customers.q10": "Can I bundle multiple services together?",
      "faq.customers.a10": "Yes! Bundling services often saves you money. For example, book Home DNA Scan + Gutter Cleaning + Pressure Washing together and receive 10-15% off the total. Our smart booking system will suggest relevant bundle deals based on your property and season.",
      "faq.customers.q11": "What if I'm not satisfied with the work?",
      "faq.customers.a11": "Your satisfaction is guaranteed. If you're unhappy with any service, report it through the app within 24 hours. We'll send the Pro back to fix the issue at no charge, or issue a full refund if the problem can't be resolved. Our Pros' ratings depend on your satisfaction.",
      "faq.customers.q12": "How long does each service typically take?",
      "faq.customers.a12": "Times vary by service: Junk removal (1-3 hours), Home Cleaning (2-4 hours), Landscaping (1-2 hours), Pressure Washing (2-5 hours), Gutter Cleaning (1-2 hours), Pool Cleaning (45-90 min), Carpet Cleaning (2-4 hours), Home DNA Scan Standard (45-90 min), Home DNA Scan Aerial (90-120 min). Your Pro provides an estimated completion time upon arrival.",
      "faq.customers.q13": "Do Pros bring their own equipment and supplies?",
      "faq.customers.a13": "Yes! All Pros arrive fully equipped with professional-grade tools, supplies, and safety gear. You don't need to provide anything. For specialized services like pressure washing or carpet cleaning, Pros use commercial equipment for superior results.",
      "faq.customers.q14": "Can you work if I'm not home?",

      "faq.pricing.a2": "No! The price you see is the price you pay. We don't charge booking fees, fuel surcharges, or environmental fees. The only time your price might change is if there are more items than originally listed, and you must approve any changes before the job starts.",

      "about.story_p1": "Todavía recuerdo el momento en que todo hizo clic. Estaba ayudando a un amigo a mudarse de su apartamento — había contratado una empresa de remoción de basura para limpiar su garaje. El Pro que llegó era increíble: cuidadoso, profesional, realmente le importaba hacer un buen trabajo. Pero cuando llegó la hora de pagar, el precio era el doble de lo que mi amigo esperaba. Sin desglose detallado. Sin prueba de adónde fue nada. Solo una factura y un \"confía en mí.\"",
      "about.story_p2": "Mi amigo perdió parte de su depósito de seguridad porque no había documentación. El Pro fue exprimido por su plataforma, apenas ganando el salario mínimo después de las comisiones. ¿Y toda esa \"basura\"?

      "about.story_p4": "Fue entonces cuando me di cuenta: tu hogar es tu mayor activo, pero tiene el peor historial de documentación. No hay un Carfax para casas. Sin historial de servicio verificado. Los propietarios no pueden probar lo que han mantenido, los inquilinos no pueden protegerse de cargos falsos, y los Pros — las personas que realmente hacen el trabajo — son tratados como mano de obra desechable.",
