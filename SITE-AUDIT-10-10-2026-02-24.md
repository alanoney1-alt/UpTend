## 5. ISSUES BY SEVERITY

### Critical (-1 each)
1. **`/certifications` returns "Page Not Found"** — Route doesn't exist in the SPA. Pro dashboard and career page both reference certifications, but there's no dedicated certifications page.
   - **Fix**: Create a `/certifications` route or redirect to the relevant section in `/academy` or `/career`

### Major (-0.5 each)
2. **Spanish mode: mixed English/Spanish on landing page** — Hero heading mixes both languages ("Reserva Tu Servicio del Hogar. Without the headache."). The "11 Services" section, "For Homeowners"/"For Pros" sections, testimonials, and "Better together" section remain in English even in ES mode.
   - **Fix**: Complete the i18n translation map for ALL sections. Currently only ~60% of the landing page translates.
   - **Deduction**: -0.5

3. **Spanish mode: /services page service cards stay English** — Service names ("Handyman Services", "Junk Removal"), descriptions, and "Book Now" buttons remain English. Only page header and surrounding chrome translate.
   - **Fix**: Add service card translations to the i18n system
   - **Deduction**: -0.5

4. **Pro profile missing expected sections** — Should show Quick Stats, Vehicle, Certifications per audit requirements. Only shows Company, Languages, Service Types.
   - **Fix**: Add Vehicle details section and Certifications display to pro profile. Quick Stats might be the rating/jobs info already shown, but Vehicle and Certs are missing.
   - **Deduction**: -0.5

5. **Google Fonts 503 error** — `fonts.googleapis.com` returning 503. May be intermittent but affects font rendering.
   - **Fix**: Add font fallbacks in CSS, consider self-hosting critical fonts
   - **Deduction**: -0.5

6. **Stripe JS 503 error** — `js.stripe.com/clover/stripe.js` failing. Could impact payment/booking completion.
   - **Fix**: Verify Stripe integration is using correct endpoint. Clover endpoint seems unusual — confirm if this is intentional or a misconfiguration.
   - **Deduction**: -0.5

### Minor (-0.25 each)
7. **Blog slugs don't match expected URLs** — `/blog/water-heater-maintenance` and `/blog/pressure-washing-guide` return 404. Actual slugs are `/blog/when-to-replace-water-heater` and `/blog/pressure-washing-guide-orlando`.
   - **Fix**: Add redirects from old slugs to new ones, or update any external links pointing to the old slugs
   - **Deduction**: -0.25

8. **Nav missing Contact, FAQ, Blog links** — These useful pages are only reachable via footer or direct URL. Customer discoverability issue.
   - **Fix**: Add Blog to nav, or at least to the mobile hamburger menu. Contact/FAQ could be under a "More" dropdown.
   - **Deduction**: -0.25

9. **First blog article on /blog missing visible title** — The first article (home-services-lake-nona) shows date and description but its heading wasn't captured in the snapshot. May be a rendering issue.
   - **Fix**: Verify the heading renders for all blog cards consistently
   - **Deduction**: -0.25
