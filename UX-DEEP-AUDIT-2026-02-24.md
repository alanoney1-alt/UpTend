# Deep UX Audit — Two Personas
## UpTend (uptendapp.com) — February 24, 2026

---

## PERSONA 1: "Maria" — First-Time Home Service User

*34, first-time homeowner in Lake Nona, never hired a pro before, found us by googling "gutter cleaning orlando," slightly nervous, speaks some Spanish*

### Step 1: Landing Page (First 5 Seconds)
**Score: 7/10**

What works:
- Clean, professional design — doesn't look like a scam
- "Book Your Home Service" headline is clear
- Service cards are visible quickly
- "No Account Required" footnote reduces friction

What's missing:
- **No social proof above the fold.** Maria doesn't see a single review, star rating, or "trusted by X homeowners" before scrolling. First-timers need reassurance IMMEDIATELY.
- **No "How It Works" visible without scrolling.** She doesn't know the process. A 3-step visual (1. Enter address → 2. Pick service → 3. Book a pro) above the fold would eliminate anxiety.
- **"Hablas Espanol?" toggle is nice** but feels like an afterthought. For Orlando's 35%+ Hispanic population, consider a more prominent bilingual welcome.
- **No phone number visible.** Nervous first-timers want to know they can call someone. Even just "(407) 338-3342" in the header builds trust.

**Maria's thought:** "This looks legit but I'm not sure if real people use this or if the pros are any good."

### Step 2: Browse Services (/services)
**Score: 8/10**

What works:
- All 11 services clearly listed with starting prices
- "from $XX" language is transparent — she knows it could be more but has a baseline
- Clean card layout, easy to scan

What's missing:
- **No "What's Included" for each service.** Maria doesn't know what "gutter cleaning" entails. Does it include downspouts? Debris removal? A quick bullet list per service would help.
- **No photos of actual work.** Before/after photos would make this real instead of abstract.
- **No "Most Popular" badge.** Guide her toward what other Lake Nona homeowners book most.

**Maria's thought:** "$129 for gutters — is that good? I have no idea. I wish they told me what that includes."

### Step 3: Book Gutter Cleaning (/book)
**Score: 8.5/10**

What works:
- Address entry is clean
- Service cards with prices are clear
- "Quick Book" vs "Choose My Pro" is a nice touch
- Trust badges (Price Guarantee, Background Checked, Insured Pros) at the top — GREAT
- FAQ accordion at the bottom answers common concerns

What's missing:
- **The flow is 6 steps.** That's a lot for a first-timer. Consider: can steps be combined? Address + service on one screen?
- **No progress indicator** (like "Step 2 of 5"). She doesn't know how much longer this takes.
- **No "Estimated Total" running counter.** She picks options without knowing the running cost until the end.
- **"AI Photo Quote" option might confuse Maria.** She might think "do I HAVE to take a photo?" Needs clearer copy: "Optional: Upload a photo for a more accurate quote"

**Maria's thought:** "This is pretty easy actually. But I'm not sure what my total will be until the end, which is a little nerve-wracking."

### Step 4: Find a Pro (/find-pro)
**Score: 7.5/10**

What works:
- Map with orange pins is engaging
- Pro cards have names, ratings, "Verified Pro" badges
- Service pills show what each pro does
- Dual buttons (View Profile / Book Now)

What's missing:
- **Reviews are placeholder-feeling.** Pro cards show ratings but no actual review snippets. Maria wants to read "Sarah was on time and did a great job" — not just see 4.8 stars.
- **No photos of pros.** Colored avatar circles feel like placeholders. Real photos (even AI-generated professional headshots) build trust massively.
- **No "Years of Experience" or "Jobs Completed" count.** These numbers build confidence.
- **No response time indicator.** "Usually responds in 2 hours" — helps Maria know what to expect.

**Maria's thought:** "Are these real people? I can't see their face or read any reviews. I'm going to Google them separately before I book."

### Step 5: Talk to George
**Score: 9/10**

Asked: "I just bought a house and I don't know what maintenance I need"

What works:
- George's response is genuinely helpful — seasonal advice, priority list, specific to Orlando climate
- No emojis (clean, professional)
- Offers to do a Home DNA Scan naturally
- Conversational tone without being patronizing

What's missing:
- **George could ask about her home specifics** (year built, pool?) to personalize advice. He has the RentCast data now — should use it.
- **No "Save this checklist" option.** She'd want to bookmark George's maintenance advice.

**Maria's thought:** "Wow, this is actually really helpful. Way better than googling. I'll come back to talk to George again."

### Step 6: Spanish Toggle
**Score: 7/10**

What works:
- Toggle is present and functional
- Hero section translates
- Service names translate on /services
- Navigation translates

What's missing:
- **~40% of content stays English** — testimonials, some value props, CTAs
- **Inconsistent — switching back and forth is jarring.** Either commit to full Spanish or clearly mark it as partial.

### Step 7: Would Maria Come Back?
**Retention Score: 6.5/10**

She'd come back IF:
- Her first job goes well (pro shows up, does good work, fair price)
- George reminded her of seasonal maintenance
- She got a follow-up email with her home's "maintenance score"

She would NOT come back if:
- She forgets UpTend exists (no app on her phone yet)
- She gets a cheaper quote elsewhere
- She never sees a reason to open the app between jobs

**Single biggest reason Maria leaves without booking:** No reviews or social proof. She'll Google "UpTend reviews" and find nothing, then go to Thumbtack where there are thousands of reviews.

## PERSONA 2: "Dave" — Experienced Home Service Customer

*52, 4BR in Winter Park, used Thumbtack/Angi, skeptical, values price/quality/reliability*

### Step 1: Landing Page
**Score: 6.5/10**

What works:
- Professional design
- Services and pricing visible quickly

What's missing for Dave:
- **Nothing differentiates UpTend from Thumbtack.** Dave's first thought: "Why would I switch?" There's no comparison, no "unlike other platforms" messaging.
- **No competitive positioning.** Something like "Transparent pricing (no hidden fees), Guaranteed price ceiling, Background-checked pros" — framed as CONTRAST to Thumbtack/Angi's problems.
- **No social proof that matters to Dave.** He wants "1,200 jobs completed" or "Rated 4.9 by Orlando homeowners" — not just a clean design.
- **The Guaranteed Price Ceiling is BURIED.** This is UpTend's killer feature for Dave (no surprise overcharges) but it's not mentioned on the landing page.

**Dave's thought:** "Looks nice but what's the catch? And why should I leave Thumbtack?"

### Step 2: Pricing Check
**Score: 8/10**

UpTend's prices are **competitive to slightly premium** for Orlando:

*(See competitive pricing table below)*

What works:
- "from" pricing is honest
- All services listed in one place (Thumbtack makes you request quotes one by one)

What's missing:
- **No "Why our prices are worth it" messaging.** Dave sees $75/hr handyman and thinks "I can find a guy on Thumbtack for $55." He needs to understand: background-checked, insured, guaranteed price, documented work.
- **No price comparison or guarantee callout.** "If you find a lower price for the same quality, we'll match it" would be powerful.

### Step 3: Booking Flow (Pressure Washing)
**Score: 8/10**

What works:
- Faster than Thumbtack (instant quote vs. waiting for 3-5 pros to respond)
- Address auto-populate is clean
- Service-specific options are relevant

What's missing:
- **Thumbtack comparison:** On Thumbtack, Dave posts a job and gets 5 pros competing with bids. Here, he gets ONE price. He might miss the competition/negotiation aspect.
- **No "Guaranteed within 48 hours" or similar SLA.** Dave's had no-shows. He wants to know pros WILL show up.

**Dave's thought:** "The instant quote is nice — faster than Thumbtack. But I can't compare multiple pros easily."

### Step 4: Find a Pro
**Score: 7/10**

Same issues as Maria, but Dave is MORE critical:
- **He wants to see completed job counts.** "47 jobs completed, 4.9 stars" matters to him.
- **He wants specialization detail.** Not just "Pressure Washing" but "Specializes in: driveways, pool decks, house exteriors"
- **He wants real reviews** with specific details, not just star counts.

**Dave's thought:** "On Thumbtack I can read 50 reviews for each pro. Here I see a star rating and nothing else."

### Step 5: George Chat
Asked: "What's the difference between you and Thumbtack?"

**Score: 8.5/10** (assuming George answers well)

George should emphasize:
1. Instant pricing (no waiting for bids)
2. Guaranteed price ceiling (no surprise upcharges)
3. Background-checked & insured (verified, not self-reported)
4. Full documentation (before/after photos, maintenance history)
5. AI-powered home management (George learns your home over time)

### Step 6: About Page
**Score: 7.5/10**

What works:
- Professional presentation
- Orlando-focused feel legitimate

What's missing:
- **No team photos or founder story.** Dave trusts people, not brands. A photo of Alan and a paragraph about why he built this goes a LONG way.
- **No "backed by investors" or business credentials.** SDVOSB status should be front and center.
- **No press mentions / awards / partnerships.** Even "As featured in Orlando Sentinel" (once you get there) matters.

### Step 7: Would Dave Switch from Thumbtack?
**Retention Score: 6/10**

He'd switch IF:
- Price ceiling guarantee saves him from an overcharge situation once — then he's a believer
- Pro quality is noticeably better than random Thumbtack contractors
- George provides actual home maintenance value between jobs
- Home DNA Scan gives him something Thumbtack never could

He would NOT switch if:
- Prices are higher with no clear quality advantage
- Pro selection feels limited (only 5 pros vs Thumbtack's 50)
- No reviews to validate quality

**The ONE thing that would convince Dave:** "Book through us, and if the pro overcharges you by even $1 beyond the quoted price, the overage is free." That's the Guaranteed Price Ceiling — but it needs to be THE headline, not buried.

## COMPETITIVE PRICING COMPARISON — Orlando, FL

| Service | UpTend | Thumbtack (Orlando avg) | Angi (Orlando avg) | Market Position |
|---------|--------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| **Gutter Cleaning (1-story)** | from $129 | $100-170 | $119-230 (avg $171) | Competitive — right in the middle |
| **Gutter Cleaning (2-story)** | from $199 | $150-250 | $175-300 | Competitive |
| **Pressure Washing (driveway)** | from $120 | $100-200 | $80-200 (avg $155) | Competitive — slightly below average |
| **Pressure Washing (house)** | from $120 | $150-400 | $100-300 | Competitive to cheap |
| **Handyman (hourly)** | from $75/hr | $50-80/hr (avg $55) | $60-85/hr | **Premium** — $20/hr above Thumbtack avg |
| **Junk Removal** | from $99 | $95-350 | $95-550 (avg $233) | **Cheap** — well below market avg |
| **Home Cleaning** | from $99 | $90-200 | $100-200 (avg $150) | Competitive to cheap |
| **Pool Cleaning (monthly)** | from $99/mo | $80-150/mo | $75-150/mo | Competitive |
| **Carpet Cleaning (per room)** | from $50/room | $40-75/room | $45-80/room | Competitive |
| **Moving Labor (per mover/hr)** | $65/hr | $50-80/hr | $60-100/hr | Competitive |

### Verdict: **UpTend pricing is generally competitive.** 
- Handyman at $75/hr is the one outlier — $20 above Thumbtack's Orlando average. Consider $65/hr to match market, OR keep $75 but heavily emphasize "background-checked, insured, guaranteed" to justify premium.
- Junk removal at $99 is a steal — well below Orlando average of $233.
- Gutter cleaning at $129 is right at market — Angi average is $171.

## RETENTION ANALYSIS

### Overall Retention Score: 6/10

**What drives return visits (already built):**
- George AI — genuinely useful between jobs for maintenance questions
- Home DNA Scan — gives a reason to come back (track your home's health)
- Referral program ($25 credit) — motivates word-of-mouth
- Property Score — gamification that encourages more services
- Seasonal reminders (if implemented via push/email)

**What's missing for retention:**

1. **Post-job follow-up sequence.** After first job completes, there should be: thank you email → review request → "Your home score increased +25 points" → "Based on your home, here's what to do next season" → referral prompt. This doesn't exist as a customer experience yet.

2. **Push notifications / email nurture.** George should reach out proactively: "Hey Maria, hurricane season starts June 1. Your gutters were last cleaned 4 months ago. Book now before the rush?"

3. **No loyalty program.** After 3 bookings, you get 10% off your 4th. After 5, you're a "Gold homeowner" with priority scheduling. Simple but sticky.

4. **Home DNA Scan is poorly positioned as a "next step."** It's on a dedicated page and George mentions it, but there's no natural trigger like "Your first service is complete — want a full home assessment for $99? Here's what we'd check..."

5. **No app on their phone.** Until the React Native app is in the App Store, retention is 100% dependent on them remembering uptendapp.com. That's a losing battle against Thumbtack's app.

## TOP 10 CHANGES TO REACH 10/10

### Priority 1 — Critical (do before Feb 28 demo)

**1. Add social proof above the fold on landing page**
- "Trusted by Orlando homeowners" + star rating + job count
- Even if numbers are small, frame honestly: "Join 50+ Lake Nona homeowners who've booked through UpTend"
- Add 2-3 short review quotes with first name + neighborhood

**2. Make Guaranteed Price Ceiling the #1 selling point**
- Add to landing page hero or immediately below: "Your price is locked at booking. Period. No surprise upcharges, ever."
- Add to every service card on /services
- Add to booking flow header
- This is the KILLER differentiator vs Thumbtack/Angi

**3. Add "How It Works" 3-step visual above the fold**
- Step 1: Enter your address → Step 2: Pick a service → Step 3: Book a verified pro
- Reduces anxiety for first-timers, shows the process is simple
- Should be visible without scrolling on desktop AND mobile

**4. Add real review snippets to /find-pro cards**
- Even 1 review quote per pro: "Great work on our driveway — Sarah T., Lake Nona"
- Add "Jobs Completed" count to each card
- Add response time estimate

### Priority 2 — Major (do this week)

**5. Add "What's Included" to each service**
- On /services page and in booking flow
- Gutter cleaning: "Includes debris removal from all gutters and downspouts, flush test, and ground cleanup"
- Reduces pricing anxiety — they know what they're paying for

**6. Add phone number to header**
- (407) 338-3342 visible on every page
- First-timers and older customers (Dave) want to know they can call

**7. Add founder story to /about page**
- Photo of Alan, 2-paragraph story: veteran, saw the problem, built the solution
- SDVOSB badge prominently displayed
- "Backed by Orlando investors" once appropriate

### Priority 3 — Important (before launch)

**8. Build post-job email sequence**
- Job complete → Thank you + review request (immediate)
- +3 days → "Your home score increased! Here's your updated report"
- +14 days → "Based on your home, here's what to plan for next month"
- +30 days → Referral prompt + seasonal recommendation

**9. Consider reducing handyman to $65/hr**
- Currently $20/hr above Thumbtack Orlando average
- At $65/hr, still profitable (pro gets 80% = $52/hr, platform gets $13/hr)
- OR keep $75 and add clear justification: "Background-checked. Insured. Guaranteed."

**10. Complete Spanish to 100%**
- Remaining ~40% of content still in English
- For Orlando's large Hispanic population, this is real revenue left on the table

## WHAT'S ALREADY GREAT (Don't Break These)

1. **George AI** — genuinely impressive, helpful, stays on topic, no emojis. This IS the differentiator.
2. **Booking flow** — works end-to-end, service-specific quote builders are smart
3. **Pricing transparency** — "from $XX" on every service is honest and competitive
4. **Trust badges on /book** — Price Guarantee, Background Checked, Insured Pros
5. **Clean design** — professional, not cluttered, loads fast
6. **Home DNA Scan concept** — unique value prop no competitor has
7. **Property Score** — gamification that could drive serious retention
8. **Map on /find-pro** — engaging, shows real local coverage
9. **FAQ on booking page** — answers common concerns at the right moment
10. **Mobile responsive** — works well on phone

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**The site is an 8.5/10 technically but a 7/10 from a customer conversion standpoint.** The biggest gap isn't bugs — it's trust signals. A first-timer (Maria) needs reviews, social proof, and "how it works" clarity. A veteran (Dave) needs competitive differentiation, the price guarantee front and center, and enough reviews to justify switching.

**The single highest-ROI change:** Put the Guaranteed Price Ceiling as the primary headline and add 3 real reviews above the fold. That alone could be the difference between a bounce and a booking.
