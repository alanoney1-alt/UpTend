## Getting Started

### Separate Business Bank Account (Day 1 Priority)

**Why This Cannot Wait:**
- IRS red flag: Mixing personal/business funds increases audit risk 300%
- Legal protection: Maintains LLC/Corp liability protection
- Financial clarity: Impossible to track profitability with mixed funds
- Tax preparation: Dramatically simplifies year-end bookkeeping

**Business Bank Account Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Choose bank with low/no monthly fees for small business
- [ ] Open business checking account (not personal account for business)
- [ ] Order business debit card and checks
- [ ] Set up online banking with bill pay features
- [ ] Connect to accounting software for automatic transaction import
- [ ] Establish relationship for future business loans/credit lines

**Recommended Banks for Small Home Services:**
- **Chase Business Complete:** $15/month, waived with $2,000 balance
- **Bank of America Business Advantage:** $16.95/month, extensive branch network
- **Capital One Spark Classic:** $0 monthly fee, good for startups
- **Local Community Banks:** Often best rates and personal service for small businesses

### Business Credit Card Strategy

**Primary Business Credit Card (Required):**
- **Purpose:** All business expenses, cash flow bridge, expense tracking
- **Target:** 0% intro APR for first 12-15 months
- **Rewards:** 2% cash back on all purchases or category bonuses
- **Limit:** Start with $5,000-10,000 limit, increase as business grows

**Best Business Credit Cards for Home Services (2026):**
- **Chase Ink Business Cash:** 5% on office supplies, internet, gas (up to $25K annually)
- **Capital One Spark Cash:** 2% unlimited cash back, no annual fee
- **American Express Blue Business Cash:** 2% on first $50K annually
- **Bank of America Business Advantage:** 3% on gas, 2% on office supplies

**Credit Card Management Rules:**
- Pay full balance monthly (never carry business debt)
- Use for ALL business expenses (maximizes cash back)
- Never mix personal expenses on business card
- Track receipts for all transactions >$25
- Set up automatic payment for minimum amount as backup

### Choosing Accounting Method: Cash vs Accrual

**Cash Method (Recommended for Most Home Services):**
- **Revenue Recognition:** When payment received
- **Expense Recognition:** When payment made
- **Eligibility:** Businesses under $25 million annual revenue
- **Benefits:** Simpler bookkeeping, better cash flow management
- **Tax Advantage:** Can delay income recognition to December 31st

**Accrual Method (Required for Some):**
- **Revenue Recognition:** When service completed/invoiced
- **Expense Recognition:** When expense incurred
- **Required:** C-Corps, businesses >$25M revenue
- **Benefits:** More accurate profit/loss timing, better for investors
- **Complexity:** Requires tracking accounts receivable/payable

**When to Switch from Cash to Accrual:**
- Approaching $25M annual revenue (must switch)
- Seeking investors or bank loans (accrual more attractive)
- Multiple revenue streams with different payment timings
- Planning to sell business (accrual shows more accurate profitability)

- **QuickBooks Mobile:** Included with subscription, decent scanning
- **Expensify:** $9/month per user, great for employee expense reports

### Mileage Tracking Disasters

**The Mistake:**
- Not tracking business mileage throughout year

### Employee vs. Independent Contractor Misclassification

**The Risk:**
- **Back Taxes:** Employer owes withheld income taxes, Social Security, Medicare
- **Penalties:** 100% penalty on unpaid withholding taxes
- **Interest:** Accrues from original due dates
- **Criminal Charges:** Willful misclassification can result in criminal penalties

**IRS Worker Classification Test:**
1. **Behavioral Control:** Do you control how work is performed?
2. **Financial Control:** Do you control business aspects of the job?
3. **Relationship Type:** Do you provide benefits, expect permanency?

**Clear W-2 Employee Indicators:**
- You provide tools and equipment
- You set work hours and schedule
- You provide training on your methods
- Worker wears your uniform
- Work is performed at your location or customer sites you control
- You have right to fire worker

**Legitimate 1099 Contractor Indicators:**
- Worker has own tools and insurance
- Worker sets own hours
- Worker has other customers
- Worker invoices you for services
- Specialized expertise you don't have
- Project-based work with defined end date

### Quarterly Estimated Tax Nightmares

**The Problem:**
- **Underpayment Penalty:** 10% annually on shortfall
- **Cash Flow Crisis:** Owing $15,000+ at tax time
- **Compounding Effect:** Penalties and interest accrue

**Quarterly Payment Strategy:**
```
Estimated Annual Profit: $80,000
Estimated Self-Employment Tax: $11,304
Estimated Income Tax: $9,600
Total Annual Tax: $20,904
Quarterly Payment: $5,226

Payment Dates:
Q1: April 15, 2026 (for Jan-Mar)
Q2: June 15, 2026 (for Apr-May)
Q3: September 15, 2026 (for Jun-Aug)
Q4: January 15, 2027 (for Sep-Dec)
```

**Safe Harbor Rules:**
- Pay 100% of last year's tax (no penalty regardless of current year)
- Pay 110% of last year's tax if prior year AGI >$150,000
- Pay 90% of current year's tax liability

### Personal/Business Expense Mixing

**The Problem:**
- **Audit Red Flag:** IRS scrutinizes mixed accounts heavily
- **Lost Deductions:** Cannot easily identify business expenses
- **Legal Issues:** Pierces corporate veil protection
- **Cash Flow Confusion:** Cannot determine business profitability

**The Separation Strategy:**
- **Business Bank Account:** All business income and expenses
- **Business Credit Card:** All business purchases only
- **Personal Reimbursement:** Reimburse yourself for business expenses paid personally
- **Clear Documentation:** Every transaction properly categorized

**Owner Draw vs. Salary Confusion:**
```
LLC/Sole Proprietorship:
Owner compensation = Draws (not deductible expense)
Record as: Owner's Draw (reduces equity)

S-Corporation:
Owner compensation = Salary + Distributions
Salary = Deductible expense, subject to payroll taxes
Distributions = Not deductible, not subject to payroll taxes
