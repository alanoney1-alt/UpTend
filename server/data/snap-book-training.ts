      title: "What You See",

      title: "When You Arrive",
      content: "Take a photo of the current condition before starting work. This protects both you and the customer. If the actual scope matches the quote — start working. If the scope is significantly different from what was quoted, use the Scope Change process: take photos of the actual condition, submit a scope change request, and wait for customer approval before proceeding with additional work."

    {
      title: "Price Protection",
      content: "The customer's quoted price is their maximum (ceiling). You earn 80% of the final price. If the job is simpler than estimated, the customer pays less and you earn accordingly. If the scope is larger, the Scope Change process handles the adjustment fairly."

      title: "Tips for Success",
      content: "Review the equipment checklist before heading out — being prepared saves time and impresses customers. Take clear before and after photos for every job. Communicate with the customer if anything looks different from the original photo."
