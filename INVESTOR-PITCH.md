# UpTend Investor Pitch

**UPYCK, Inc. (Delaware C-Corp) d/b/a UpTend**

## The $600B Problem

Home services = $600B/year in the US. Every HOA, property manager, general contractor, and government agency needs vendors. They manage it with phone calls, spreadsheets, and a rolodex of "guys."

Nobody has built the AI-powered operating system that institutional buyers need: compliance-grade vendor management, real-time dispatch, government contract automation, and a vetted workforce at scale.

**UpTend has. And it's live.**

---

## What We Built

**148 client routes. 131 server routes. Live at uptendapp.com.**

- **George**: AI Home Service Agent with 176 tools. Quotes jobs, books services, remembers every home, routes to the right fulfillment entity automatically.
- **B2B Dashboard**: Portfolio analytics, property health scores, ESG compliance, vendor scorecards, spending analytics, board reports.
- **Government Suite**: SDVOSB set-asides, Davis-Bacon automation, WH-347 payroll, SAM.gov integration.
- **Consumer Marketplace**: 12 service verticals, instant quoting, diagnostic intake, Home DNA Scan, Home Memory.

## Three Revenue Channels, One Tech Stack

### Channel 1: Consumer Marketplace (UpTend DBA)
1099 gig pros. 20% platform fee (5% customer + 15% pro). Think Uber for home services, but with an AI agent that actually knows your home.

### Channel 2: B2B Services (UpTend Business Services LLC)
W2 employees servicing HOAs, property managers, and construction companies. Premium pricing. Recurring contracts.

**The B2B pitch is three wins in one contract:**

**Win 1 — Their residents get George.** Every resident gets a 24/7 AI concierge. Texts George, gets instant service. Covered repairs at zero cost. Not-covered services get transparent quotes. Resident satisfaction goes up, lease renewals go up, complaints at board meetings disappear.

**Win 2 — Their office gets a dashboard.** Live job tracking, property health scores, ESG compliance reports, spending analytics, vendor scorecards. "Your current vendor sends you an invoice. We send you intelligence."

**Win 3 — Trained W2 crews.** 12 verticals, one contract. Background checked, insured, branded. Same crew every time. Recurring schedules on autopilot. Emergency response 24/7.

**The close:** "Every PM and HOA has maintenance vendors. None of them have an AI agent that knows every unit, a dashboard that tracks every dollar, and a trained crew that handles every service."

### Channel 3: Government (UpTend Services LLC — SDVOSB)
Federal sole-source contracts up to $5M with zero competition. State/local preference points. SDVOSB certification is a strategic weapon.

## Corporate Structure

```
               UPYCK, Inc. (C-Corp)
              Owns all IP. Investor entity.
             /          |            \
      UpTend (DBA)    B2B LLC     Services LLC
      Consumer Gig    W2 B2B      Government
      1099 Pros       HOAs/PMs    SDVOSB
      20% take        35% fees    55% fees
           \            |            /
            All flow up to UPYCK Inc
```

UPYCK captures 35-55% of every dollar flowing through the LLCs via licensing fees (technology, marketing, brand, operations). One tech stack powers three revenue channels.

## How George Routes It All

When a resident requests service, George automatically checks:

1. Is this property under a B2B contract?
2. Is this service covered?
3. Route accordingly:
   - **Covered** → W2 crew, bill the PM/HOA, no cost to resident
   - **Not covered** → Consumer marketplace, transparent pricing
   - **No contract** → Standard gig pro booking

One property generates revenue through both channels simultaneously. The resident never sees the corporate structure. They just talk to George.

## Sponsored Product Placement (Year 2-3 Revenue)

George recommends products during natural conversation: "Your AC filter is 6 months overdue. Here's the exact one for your unit" with an affiliate link. Never disclosed as ads. Always genuinely relevant. Credibility first.

At scale, this becomes a high-margin revenue stream with zero fulfillment cost.
