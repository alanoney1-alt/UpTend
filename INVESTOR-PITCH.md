## The $600B Problem

Home services is a $600B/year industry in the US. Every homeowner, HOA, property manager, and government agency needs vendors. They manage it with phone calls, spreadsheets, and a rolodex of "guys."

Nobody has built the AI-powered operating system that handles both sides: an agent that knows your home and a platform that runs the business.

**UpTend has. And it's live.**

---

## What We Built

## Two Entities, Three Revenue Channels

### UPYCK, Inc. (DBA "UpTend") -- The Platform

**Channel 1: Consumer Marketplace**
Service company partners and 1099 pros fulfill jobs. 20% platform fee (5% customer + 15% pro). George owns the customer relationship, handles all communication, and remembers every home. Partners get steady volume, automated scheduling, instant payments, and zero marketing spend.

**Channel 2: B2B Platform (HOAs, Property Managers, Construction)**
Same partnership model, bigger contracts. SaaS subscription per unit/door plus per-job transaction fees.

**The B2B pitch:**
- **Residents get George.** 24/7 AI concierge for any home service need. Covered repairs at zero cost, transparent quotes for everything else.
- **The office gets a dashboard.** Live job tracking, property health scores, budget vs. actual spending, vendor scorecards.
- **One contract covers all 12 verticals.** No more juggling 8 vendors with 8 invoices.

"Your current vendor sends you an invoice. We send you intelligence."

### UpTend Services LLC -- Government (SDVOSB)

**Channel 3: Government Contracts**
SDVOSB certified (Dennis 51% / Alan 49%). Federal sole-source contracts up to $5M. W2 veteran employees for self-performance requirements, service company partners for overflow and specialty work. 55% of LLC revenue flows to UPYCK as licensing/management fees.

## Corporate Structure

```
           UPYCK, Inc. (C-Corp)
          Owns all IP. All investor equity.
          Operates UpTend (DBA).
         /                          \
  Consumer + B2B               UpTend Services LLC
  (via UpTend DBA)             (SDVOSB Government)
  1099 pros + service          W2 vets + service
  company partnerships         company partnerships
  20% platform fee             55% licensing to UPYCK
```

Two entities. Clean. Simple. UPYCK captures platform fees directly on consumer/B2B and 55% of every government dollar through licensing fees (technology, marketing, brand, admin, operations management).

## The Service Company Partnership Model

This is the engine. Instead of hiring W2 employees for consumer and B2B work, UpTend partners with existing small service companies.

**What partners get:**
- Consistent job volume (consumer + B2B contracts they'd never land alone)
- Automated scheduling, invoicing, customer communication, payments
- A brand customers trust (zero marketing spend for partners)
- Next-day Stripe deposits

**What UpTend gets:**
- Skilled labor without W2 overhead (no payroll tax, workers comp, benefits)
- Scalable capacity (add partners as demand grows, zero fixed costs)
- Insurance, trucks, tools, and equipment partners already own

**Why partners can't cut us out:**
- George owns the customer relationship on both sides
- Partners never get customer contact info directly
- B2B contracts are with UpTend, not the service company
- Platform (scheduling, payments, tracking, reviews) is stickier than a phone number
- Volume is distributed. No single partner has leverage to walk.

**Example:** A pressure washing LLC doing 8 jobs/week averaging $300. Spends $240/week on Angi leads. Nets $2,160. With UpTend: 12 jobs/week, $300 avg, minus 15% = $3,060 net. Makes $900/week more and spends $0 on marketing.

## The Moat

### 1. George Gets Smarter
Every conversation, job, photo, and review compounds George's intelligence. After 1,000 Orlando jobs, George knows which services every neighborhood needs, which partners perform best, and what to ask before the homeowner describes the problem. A competitor starting from scratch has zero data.

### 2. Home Memory is Irreplaceable
Once a homeowner's property is in the system (appliances, maintenance history, past jobs, pro observations), switching means losing everything. Their home's entire history lives in UpTend.

### 3. Two-Sided Network Effects
More homeowners = more jobs for partners. More partners = faster service for homeowners. More B2B contracts = more partner volume. Each side makes the other more valuable. This flywheel can't be shortcut.

## How George Routes Everything

When a resident requests service, George automatically checks:

1. Is this address under a B2B contract?
2. Is this service covered?
3. Route accordingly:
   - **Covered** --> Assign partner, bill the PM/HOA, no cost to resident
   - **Not covered** --> Consumer marketplace, transparent pricing to resident
   - **No contract** --> Standard consumer booking

One property generates revenue through multiple channels. The resident just talks to George.

## 5-Year Outlook (Moderate Traction)

_Orlando Years 1-2. Jacksonville + Tampa Year 3._

| Year | Consumer | B2B | Government | Total UPYCK Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026 | $15K | $34K | $0 | $49K |
| 2027 | $110K | $260K | $82.5K | $467.5K |
| 2028 | $580K | $1.39M | $330K | $2.36M |
| 2029 | $1.8M | $4.08M | $825K | $6.86M |
| 2030 | $4.34M | $8.56M | $1.65M | $14.85M |

**Year 5 at 6-10x revenue multiple = $89-149M valuation.**

No W2 overhead on consumer/B2B means margins stay high. Partnership model scales without proportional cost increases.

---

## Sponsored Product Placement (Year 2+)

George recommends products during natural conversation: "Your AC filter is 6 months overdue. Here's the exact one for your unit." Native recommendations, never disclosed as ads, always genuinely relevant. High-margin revenue with zero fulfillment cost.

---

## Why NOW

- **Orlando**: 2.7M metro, highest HOA density in America, year-round demand, zero competition for "home services Lake Nona" SEO
- **AI is ready**: George couldn't exist 2 years ago. Tool use, conversational memory, and vision analysis are production grade now.
- **SDVOSB**: Federal sole-source up to $5M. 200K veterans transition annually. SkillBridge = DoD pays their salary while they train with us.
- **Service companies want this**: Small operators are drowning in Angi fees. A platform that gives them steady work and handles the business side? They'll line up.

---
