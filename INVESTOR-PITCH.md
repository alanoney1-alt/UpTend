## The $600 Billion Problem Nobody Has Solved

The home services industry generates **$600 billion annually** in the United States. Every HOA, every property management company, every general contractor, every government agency — they all need vendors. Thousands of them. Every single day.

And they're still managing it with **phone calls, spreadsheets, and prayer.**

Thumbtack connects consumers to handymen. ServiceTitan sells software to plumbers. Nobody — **absolutely nobody** — has built the operating system that institutional buyers actually need: compliance-grade vendor management with real-time dispatch, government contract automation, and a vetted workforce at scale.

**UpTend has. And it's already live.**

## What We Built (While Everyone Else Was Talking)

**110+ production features.** Not wireframes. Not pitch decks. Not "coming soon." **Live. Deployed. Demoable right now.**

🤖 **13 AI capabilities** — real Claude AI powering instant estimates, photo quotes, document scanning, route optimization, and George, our AI concierge that guides every interaction.

🏛️ **Full government contract suite** — Davis-Bacon prevailing wage automation, WH-347 certified payroll generation, SAM.gov integration, DBE/SDVOSB utilization tracking, FEMA rapid response activation. No home services company on Earth has this.

🏘️ **HOA & Property Management OS** — multi-community dashboards, board approval workflows, tenant work orders, make-ready turnover automation, SLA management. One PM company sale = hundreds of units = recurring revenue for years.

🏗️ **Construction sub management** — punch lists, lien waiver automation, permit tracking, safety compliance. GCs are begging for this.

🎖️ **America's veteran workforce platform** — DD-214 verification, MOS-to-trade mapping, SDVOSB certification tracking, disabled veteran accommodations, military spouse program. 200,000 service members transition annually. We catch them.

💳 **Stripe payments, real-time WebSocket tracking, email notifications, review system, ESG impact scoring** — the full stack, production-hardened, deployed on Railway.

## The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Total Addressable Market** | $600B+ annually |
| **B2B Institutional Market** | $400B+ (HOAs, PMs, Construction, Government) |
| **Federal SDVOSB Set-Asides** | $4B+/year (sole source up to $5M — zero competition) |
| **FEMA Disaster Contracts (FL alone)** | $500M+ per hurricane season |
| **Average Consumer Job** | $150–$500 one-time |
| **Average B2B Contract** | $25K–$500K annually, recurring |
| **Platform Fees** | 7% customer + 20-25% pro side |
| **One 500-unit PM company** | $84K–$300K/year in platform revenue |

---

## Why NOW

**Florida is ground zero.** 40M+ tourists, explosive population growth, hurricane-driven demand spikes, and the largest concentration of HOAs in America. We're launching in Orlando Metro — the perfect proving ground — then expanding statewide, then nationally.

**The veteran angle is a strategic weapon.** Our SDVOSB-certified subsidiary (51% minority veteran-owned) unlocks federal sole-source contracts up to $5M with **zero competition**. State and local contracts give preference points for veteran labor. Every veteran we recruit is simultaneously a skilled worker AND a compliance asset.

**AI is our moat.** While competitors bolt chatbots onto legacy platforms, we built AI into the foundation. George doesn't just answer questions — he quotes jobs, books services, optimizes schedules, and manages the entire customer relationship. Our 13 AI capabilities aren't features. They're the product.

## The Competitive Landscape (We Have None)

| Competitor | What They Do | What They Don't Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Thumbtack/Angi** | Consumer lead gen | Zero B2B, zero compliance, zero government |
| **Jobber/Housecall Pro** | Pro business tools | No marketplace, no institutional buyers |
| **ServiceTitan** | Single-trade SaaS | No multi-trade marketplace, $15K+/year per customer |
| **Procore** | Construction PM | No vendor marketplace, no home services |
| **UpTend** | **ALL OF THE ABOVE** | — |

We're not competing. We're creating a category.

## The Flywheel That Prints Money

```
More B2B contracts → More job volume → More veteran recruitment
       ↑                                         ↓
Higher retention ← Stable pro income ← Government set-asides
       ↑                                         ↓
More investors ← Proven recurring revenue ← More contracts won
```

Every B2B client we sign generates recurring revenue that funds more veteran recruitment, which unlocks more government contracts, which attracts more institutional buyers. **This flywheel doesn't slow down. It accelerates.**

## What $100K Gets You

- **10% equity** at a $1M cap (pre-revenue SAFE)
- Ground floor of the **only platform** that serves institutional home services buyers
- Exposure to **$4B+ in federal set-aside contracts** through our SDVOSB certification
- A founding team that doesn't just plan — **we ship.** 110+ features, live site, deployed in weeks, not years
- First-mover advantage in a $600B market where the incumbents are asleep

---

## The Bottom Line

You're not investing in an idea. You're investing in a **live, deployed, 110-feature platform** with a clear path to revenue through the most underserved, highest-value segment of home services: institutional buyers who write six-figure annual contracts.

The technology is built. The veteran pipeline is ready. The government contracts are waiting. The only question is whether you want to be on the cap table when this thing takes off — or watching from the sidelines wishing you'd moved faster.

**UpTend. Built Different. Built to Win.**
