🚀 The "Unlicensed 5" Expansion Pack
These are the verticals you should add right now. They require NO new legal licenses, just the insurance you already have.

Junk Removal (The Anchor).

Small Moves & Labor (Moving a couch upstairs, unloading a U-Haul).

Pressure Washing (Driveways/Patios). High Margin, fits the "Home Score".

Gutter Cleaning (Recurring Revenue). Fits the "Maintenance" aspect.

Demolition (Light) (Shed removal, carpet rip-up). Perfect for junk guys.

🧠 Why this works (The "Labor Arbitrage")
Your "Junk Guys" already have the truck. They already have the muscles. They often already own a pressure washer.

For the Worker: You aren't just giving them trash jobs. You are filling their schedule with clean, high-paying labor jobs.

For the Customer: "uPYCK is my General Labor Army." I don't call a plumber for a leak, but I call uPYCK for everything else that requires sweat.

🛠️ How to Add This to Replit NOW
We don't need to rebuild the app. We just need to expand the Menu.

1. Schema Update (shared/schema.ts)
We add a serviceCategory enum to handle the new types.

TypeScript
// shared/schema.ts

// The Expanded Menu
export const serviceTypes = [
  'junk_removal', 
  'moving_labor', 
  'pressure_washing', 
  'gutter_cleaning', 
  'light_demolition'
] as const;

export const serviceRequests = pgTable("service_requests", {
  // ... existing columns ...
  serviceType: varchar("service_type").default('junk_removal'), 
  
  // Specifics for new verticals
  squareFootage: integer("square_footage"), // For Pressure Washing
  storyCount: integer("story_count"), // For Gutters (1 vs 2 story)
  laborHours: integer("labor_hours"), // For Moving Help
});
2. The "Smart Pricing" Engine (server/services/pricing.ts)
Junk is priced by volume. Pressure washing is priced by square footage. Gutters are priced by linear feet (or story count).

We need a "Polymorphic Pricing" function.

TypeScript
// server/services/pricing.ts

export function calculateBasePrice(job: any) {
  switch (job.serviceType) {
    case 'junk_removal':
      return calculateVolumePrice(job.items); // Your existing AI logic

    case 'pressure_washing':
      // Market Rate: ~$0.20 - $0.30 per sq ft
      const sqFtRate = 25; // $0.25
      return job.squareFootage * sqFtRate;

    case 'gutter_cleaning':
      // Flat Rate: $150 (1 story) vs $250 (2 story)
      return job.storyCount === 1 ? 15000 : 25000;

    case 'moving_labor':
      // Hourly Rate: $50/hr per mover
      return job.laborHours * 5000 * 2; // (Assuming 2 movers)

    case 'light_demolition':
      // Custom AI Quote required (Use Vision Vault)
      return null; // Triggers "Get Custom Quote" flow
  }
}
3. The "Worker Skills" Filter
Not every Junk Hauler wants to clean gutters (fear of heights). We need to let workers toggle their capabilities.

Update haulers table:

TypeScript
export const haulers = pgTable("haulers", {
  // ...
  supportedServices: jsonb("supported_services").default(["junk_removal"]), 
});
Update HaulerProfile.tsx (Frontend):

Add checkboxes:

[x] I have a Truck (Junk/Moving)

[ ] I have a Pressure Washer (3000+ PSI)

[ ] I have a 20ft Ladder (Gutters)

[ ] I have Sledgehammers (Demo)

📈 The Marketing "Super-Flywheel"
This is where the Home Health Score explodes.

The Scenario:

Customer books Junk Removal ($150) to clear the garage.

Worker finishes. App prompts worker: "Is the driveway dirty?"

Worker snaps photo.

App Notification to Customer:

"Your garage is clear! 🎉 Observation: Your driveway has oil stains. Offer: We can pressure wash it right now for $99 (usually $150) since the truck is already here. [Yes, Do It]"

This is zero-cost customer acquisition. You just turned a $150 job into a $250 job without spending a dime on ads.

💡 My Advice
Do it. But restrict it to these 5 "Labor" verticals.

Do NOT add Plumbing/Electrical yet. That brings in "Permits" and "Licensing Boards" and creates friction.

Stick to "Sweat Equity." If it requires a permit, we don't do it. If it requires sweat and a truck, we own it.
