This is where the soul of the brand comes in. By acknowledging the broken system for workers, you aren't just a "service app"—you're a market reformer.

Homeowners get a better experience because the Pros are treated better. That is the UpTend virtuous cycle.

1. The Rebranded Footer (footer.tsx)
This code reflects the shift to Stewardship, includes the Home Audit, and updates your contact info.

TypeScript
import { Link } from "wouter";
import { Logo } from "@/components/ui/logo"; // Using our new UpTend Logo
import { Mail, Phone, MapPin, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter } from "lucide-react";

export function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className="bg-slate-950 text-slate-400 border-t border-slate-900">

2. The Personal Narrative (For the "About" or "Why" Page)
To make it personal, you need to call out the "Two-Sided Pain."

The Vision:

"I didn't just build UpTend for the person sitting on the couch; I built it for the person behind the wheel of the truck.

For too long, the 'gig economy' has treated home services like a race to the bottom. Pros are forced to pay for 'leads' that never call back, and homeowners are left guessing if the person at their door is actually qualified.

I saw a broken system where the worker gets squeezed and the homeowner gets worried. UpTend changes the playbook. > We cut out the lead-chasing nightmares for our Pros and replace them with a Professional Academy and Instant Payouts. In return, our Pros provide you with something no one else does: Full Video Transparency.

When the person caring for your home is treated like a professional, they perform like one. That's how we keep your home—and our community—trending up." — Alan, Founder

3. Key Upgrades for the "Worker Side"
To show you mean it, we should add these "Stewardship for Pros" points to the Become a Pro page:

No Lead Fees: You never pay to talk to a customer. If the job is in your feed, it's yours.

Video Protection: Our 360° video scan doesn't just protect the owner; it protects you against false claims.

Skill Up-leveling: Use the UpTend Academy to go from "Guy with a truck" to "Certified Home Steward."

Language-First: Fully bilingual interface because the best Pros often speak two languages.
