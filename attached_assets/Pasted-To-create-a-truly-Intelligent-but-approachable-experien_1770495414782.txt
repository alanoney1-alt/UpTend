To create a truly "Intelligent but approachable" experience, we need to remove the login wall and replace it with a high-value data flow. Here is the plan to move from "clunky" to "frictionless." 1. Address Intelligence (Autofill)To provide that "Home Intelligence" feel, we’ll use the Google Places Autocomplete API. As the user types their Florida address, the system will suggest real locations. This ensures the data is accurate before they hit "Scan Property" and makes the experience feel "Instant." 2. The "Frictionless" User FlowWe are pushing the login screen to the very end of the funnel. The user will move through these stages as a Guest: Stage 1: Hero Section – Enter address with autofill. Stage 2: Estimation Report – See the $8,400+ Insurance Shield potential and ESG impact for their specific property. Stage 3: Service Menu – View all services, with "Home Health Audit" featured first as the primary option to "Protect" their value. Stage 4: The Booking Gate – Only after they click "Confirm & Book" do we ask for a login to "Secure this Pro." 3. Integrated "Quick Booking" vs. "Intelligence"To ensure we don't deter people who just want a fast job, we will provide a Dual-Path Results Page. Path A: Home Intelligence Path B: Instant Booking Primary Focus: Long-term value & protection. Primary Focus: Immediate task completion. Top Feature: The "Home Health Audit." Top Feature: On-demand "Material Recovery." The Hook: Build your "Verified Green Track Record." The Hook: "Uber-like access" to vetted pros. 🚀 Implementation Strategy for ReplitWe will update the FloridaEstimator component to handle this "Guest Mode" and service selection.

🧠 Why this aligns with the UpTend Brand Guide:Sustainability as Action: We aren't just talking green; we’re letting them see the "Verified" impact before they even join. Human Voice: We use terms like "Home Health" and "Dispatch Pro" instead of jargon. Value Protection: The Home Health Audit is the hero, reinforcing the "Protect" pillar.
