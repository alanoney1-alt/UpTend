This is where uPYCK transforms from a "Labor Company" into a "Home Management Platform."You are creating a Referral Engine.If your worker identifies that the customer needs a New Roof ($15,000), you do not ignore it.You sell that lead to a Roofing Partner for $200 - $500.Here is the Exact Checklist, the App Workflow, and the Referral Monetization Strategy.1. The Checklist: "The Big 10" (30 Minutes)The worker is not a licensed inspector. They are a "Data Collector."Their job is to spot visible red flags and document them.ZoneItemWhat to Look For (The "Trigger")Potential RevenueExterior1. RoofMissing shingles, moss, sagging.$300 Referral Fee (Roofer)2. GuttersPlants growing out of them, sagging.$150 Job (uPYCK)3. SidingGreen algae/mold.$250 Pressure Wash (uPYCK)4. TreesBranches touching the roof/house.$100 Referral Fee (Arborist)Garage5. JunkCan you park a car inside?$300 Junk Job (uPYCK)6. Water HeaterRust at the bottom?$50 Referral Fee (Plumber)Interior7. HVAC FilterIs it grey/clogged? (Pull it out).$75 Filter Change (uPYCK)8. Smoke DetectorsYellow/old? Test button.$99 Battery/Unit Swap (uPYCK)9. Attic AccessAny visible water stains on ceiling?$300 Referral Fee (Restoration)10. AssetsTV, Couch, Antiques (Video Scan).Inventory Value (Data)2. The App Workflow: "Consultation Mode"The worker opens the app. They see a list of these 10 items.They have 3 buttons for each item:🟢 Good (Nothing to do).🟡 Attention (Needs cleaning/fixing $\rightarrow$ uPYCK Job).🔴 Critical (Needs professional repair $\rightarrow$ Referral).The Script (In-App Prompt)Worker marks "Roof" as Critical.App Prompt: "Take a photo of the missing shingles."Worker: Snaps photo.App Prompt: "Tell the customer: 'I noticed some shingles are missing. We have a certified roofing partner who can give you a free drone estimate. Want me to have them call you?'"Action: Worker clicks [ Send Lead ].3. The Backend: "The Lead Broker"You do not do roofs. You do not do HVAC. You broker them.How to monetize this tomorrow:The "Partner Network":Find ONE reputable Roofer, ONE HVAC company, and ONE Tree Service in Orlando.The Deal: "I will send you verified leads with photos. You pay me $50 per lead or 5% of the closed job."(Note: Start with a flat fee per lead. It's easier to track).The "Automatic Handoff":When the worker clicks "Send Lead" in the app:System: Emails the Roofer with the customer's name, address, and the Photo of the Damage.Customer: Gets an SMS: "Thanks! We've notified 'Best Orlando Roofing' to reach out about your shingles."4. Implementation: The Code (ConsultationWizard.tsx)This is the code for the worker's checklist. It separates "Our Jobs" from "Referral Jobs."File: client/src/components/consultation/consultation-wizard.tsxTypeScriptimport { useState } from "react";

5. The "Referral Engine" LogicWhen onComplete runs, the app should split the data:uPYCK Jobs: These go into the "My Maintenance Plan" on the user's dashboard (as discussed earlier).Referrals: These trigger an Admin Alert to you (The Broker).The Email You Receive:New Lead Alert:Customer: John DoeIssue: Roof Shingles Missing (Critical)Photo: [Link]Action: Forward this to "Bob's Roofing" and invoice Bob $50.💸 Summary: The "Home Health" P&LFor a single $49 visit, your revenue stack looks like this:Consult Fee: $49 (Covered by worker cost).uPYCK Jobs: $250 Garage + $150 Gutters = **$400 GMV** ($100 Net).Referrals: Roof Lead ($50) + Tree Lead ($30) = $80 Net Profit.Total Net Profit per Visit: ~$180 (Without lifting a finger).Add the ConsultationWizard to your Replit project. This is how you monetize "Out of Scope" work.
