4. 👷 The New Worker Flow (Pro Journey)We rebranded them from "Haulers" to "Asset Managers."Step 1: The "Academy" GateScenario: New worker signs up.Blocker: Cannot see jobs until they pass the 4-module quiz (Code we wrote earlier).Step 2: The "Opportunity" FeedOld: List of addresses.New: "Smart Cards" showing Potential Earnings.Example: "Gutter Cleaning | $150 Guaranteed + Potential $99 Upsell."Step 3: The "Universal Wizard"Scenario: They arrive at a Moving Job.Screen: The app shows the Time Clock (Start/Stop).Scenario: They arrive at a Junk Job.Screen: The app shows Before/After Camera.Step 4: The "Field Audit"Action: They spot a dirty driveway.Tool: They click "Upsell" $\rightarrow$ Customer gets SMS $\rightarrow$ Customer clicks "Approve."Result: Worker makes an extra $60 instantly.5. 🚀 Final VerificationTo ensure the Frontend matches the Backend, you must update your main Booking page to use the ServiceMenu component above.Action:Add client/src/components/booking/service-menu.tsx (Paste the code above).Update client/src/pages/book.tsx to import and use <ServiceMenu /> as the first step.Once that is pasted, your Rebrand is live. The customer sees the "Home OS," the worker sees the "Academy," and the pricing engine handles the math.
