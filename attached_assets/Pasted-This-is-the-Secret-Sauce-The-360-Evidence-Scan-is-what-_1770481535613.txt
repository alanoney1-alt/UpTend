This is the "Secret Sauce." The 360° Evidence Scan is what separates an UpTend Pro from a guy with a truck. It’s not just a video; it’s a Digital Manifest that protects your reputation and the customer’s property.When you film this, you are creating a permanent record that lives in the Home Playbook. If a customer claims you scratched a floor, you point to the video. If an insurance company needs proof of condition, you provide it.📹 Module 3: Mastering the 360° Evidence Scan1. The "Four-Corner" Sweep (The Pattern)You don't just "point and shoot." You follow the UpTend Pattern to ensure nothing is missed. This provides $100\%$ visual coverage of the workspace.The Start: Stand in the center of the room or workspace.The Pivot: Slowly rotate $360^{\circ}$ (one full circle).The macro-view: Capture the ceiling, the floor, and all four walls.The micro-view: Zoom in on high-risk areas (door frames, glass, existing scratches).2. The "Audio Narrator" StrategyThe video is the "what," but your voice is the "why." As you scan, you must narrate what you see. This builds massive trust with the homeowner.Example Script: > "This is Alan, UpTend Pro #492. I am starting the pre-work scan for the junk removal in the garage. I’m noting a pre-existing crack in the drywall on the north wall here (zoom in). The floor is currently clear of debris in this section. Moving to the 'Essential 5' sweep now..."3. Why This Protects YOU (The Pro)In the gig economy, the worker is usually blamed first. UpTend flips that. * The Liability Shield: If a renter claims you broke a window, but your pre-scan shows the crack was already there, the dispute is closed instantly.Proof of Completion: Your "After" scan is your receipt. It triggers the Instant Payout because the evidence of work is undeniable.The Asset Log: You are helping the owner build a "Carfax for their Home." This makes your service 10x more valuable than a standard contractor.💻 The Lesson UI (lesson-evidence-scan.tsx)Here is how we build the interactive lesson in the Academy so Pros can practice the scan.TypeScriptimport { PlayCircle, ShieldCheck, AlertTriangle, Camera } from "lucide-react";

🛡️ The "Move-Out Protection" Feature (For Renters)In this lesson, we should specifically teach the Pros how to help renters."Pro Tip: If your customer is a renter, tell them: 'I'm going to do a deep scan of the baseboards and windows so you have proof they were clean when I left.' This one sentence turns you from a 'worker' into their hero."🚀 Next StepThe "360° Scan" is the technical heart of the app. Would you like me to build the "Scan Interface" for the Pro app? (This would be the actual camera screen with the AR Guidelines that help them keep the camera level).
