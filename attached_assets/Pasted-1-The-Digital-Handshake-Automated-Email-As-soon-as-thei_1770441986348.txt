1. The "Digital Handshake" (Automated Email)
As soon as their background check clears, they get this email. It sets the tone: You are a business owner, here is your manual.

Subject: Welcome to uPYCK Pro: Unlock Your Account 🔓

Body:

"Welcome to the Network.

You have passed the background check. To activate your account and start receiving jobs, you must complete the uPYCK Protocol Certification (15 minutes).

Why Certify?

Unlock The App: You cannot see jobs until you pass.

Earn More: Certified Pros get access to the "Unlicensed 5" (Pressure Washing, Moving, etc.).

Get Paid Faster: Learn how to trigger instant payouts.

2. The In-App "Pycker Academy" (The Screen)
We don't send them to a boring YouTube playlist. We build the "course" right inside the app. They swipe through cards and answer questions.

The Curriculum (4 Modules):

The "White Glove" Standard:

Lesson: We are not "Junk Guys." We are "Asset Managers."

Rule: Clean uniform (or uPYCK shirt). No smoking on site.

Quiz: "What do you do if a customer asks to remove extra items?"

A) Do it for free.

B) Use the 'Update Scope' tool in the app to get paid. (Correct)

The App Mechanics:

Lesson: How the "Ghost Buster" GPS works. Why you must take "Before & After" photos.

Rule: If you don't upload a photo, the payout is locked.

Quiz: "When does the insurance policy kick in?"

A) When I wake up.

B) When I slide 'Start Job' in the app. (Correct)

The "Upsell" (Making Money):

Lesson: How to spot a dirty driveway or full gutters.

Script: "I noticed your driveway is slippery. Since I'm here, I can wash it for $99. Want me to add that?"

Quiz: "You finish a junk job and see a shed. What do you do?"

A) Leave.

B) Offer a demo quote via the app. (Correct)

The "Golden Rules" (Zero Tolerance):

Lesson: No cash deals. No harassment. No dumping illegally.

Consequence: One strike = Permanent Ban.

3. The Tech: Build the "Academy" Component
Here is the React code for the onboarding flow. Add this to your replit.

File: client/src/pages/hauler-onboarding/academy.tsx

TypeScript
import { useState } from "react";
import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress";
import { CheckCircle, AlertTriangle, DollarSign } from "lucide-react";
import { useLocation } from "wouter";

const MODULES = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "The uPYCK Standard",
    content: "We are not just hauling junk. We are protecting home value. Always wear a collared shirt or uPYCK gear. Introduce yourself by name.",
    question: "How should you greet the customer?",
    options: ["'Yo, where's the trash?'", "'Hi, I'm [Name] with uPYCK. I'm here to help.'"],
    correct: 1
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Get Paid Correctly",
    content: "Never negotiate cash. If the customer adds items, use the 'Adjust Scope' button. The customer approves the new price on their phone instantly.",
    question: "The customer adds a sofa. What do you do?",
    options: ["Take cash", "Update the App Scope"],
    correct: 1
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "The Upsell",
    content: "Look for dirty driveways or full gutters. You earn 100% of the upsell labor. Turn a $150 job into a $300 job in seconds.",
    question: "You see a dirty driveway. You should:",
    options: ["Ignore it", "Offer a $99 Pressure Wash via the App"],
    correct: 1
  }

4. The "Field Guide" (The PDF Cheat Sheet)
Once they pass, email them a simple 1-page PDF they can keep in their truck.

Title: The uPYCK Pro Field Guide

The 5 Commandments:

Arrive on Time: The app tracks GPS. Being late hurts your algorithm score.

Photos or No Pay: You must upload a "Clean Space" photo to unlock payment.

Upsell Everything: Dirty driveway? Full gutters? Offer to fix it.

Recycle First: Donate what you can. Upload the receipt for a tax bonus.

Stay in the App: Cash deals = Instant Ban + No Insurance.

5. The "First Job" Protocol (Quality Control)
You are nervous about the first job. You should be.

The Feature: "Rookie Mode"

Logic: For a worker's first 3 jobs, the app automatically flags them for "Manual Review."

Process:

Worker uploads "After" photo.

Payout is paused for 1 hour.

Admin (You) gets a notification: "Rookie completed Job #1. Check photos."

You look at the photo. If it's good, you click "Approve Payout."

Worker gets a notification: "Great job! Payment released."

Why this works: It catches bad apples immediately before they ruin your reputation. After 3 good jobs, the system switches them to "Auto-Pay."

Summary
Don't hold seminars. Build the "Pycker Academy" into the app.

Don't guess. Force them to pass the Quiz.

Don't trust blindly. Use "Rookie Mode" to manually check their first 3 jobs.

Add the PyckerAcademy component to your app now. It is the automated gatekeeper for your quality.
