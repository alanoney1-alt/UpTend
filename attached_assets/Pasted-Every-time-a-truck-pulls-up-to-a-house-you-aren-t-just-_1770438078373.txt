Every time a truck pulls up to a house, you aren't just removing junk; you are verifying the asset's condition.

Here is the full roadmap for the uPYCK Property Score ecosystem.

1. The Algorithm: How Services = Points
You need a scoring model (0–850, like FICO) that rewards responsible ownership. Every uPYCK service triggers a point increase.

The Scorecard (Examples):
Junk Removal (Decluttering): +15 Points.

Why? A hoarded home has structural risks, mold, and pests. Verified removal proves the home is "Clean & Clear."

Moving (Move-In Clean): +25 Points.

Why? A "Deep Clean" upon move-in establishes a baseline of hygiene for the next 7 years.

HVAC Filter Change (Labor): +10 Points (Recurring).

Why? This is the #1 predictor of AC longevity. Verified change = Extended asset life.

Garage Cleanout: +20 Points.

Why? Access to the electrical panel/water heater is often blocked by junk. Clearance proves safety compliance.

2. The "Verified Event" Ledger (Blockchain-Lite)
We stop calling them "Receipts." We call them "Verified Events." When a worker completes a job, the App generates a digital certificate that attaches to the address.

The Certificate: "Verified Garage Clearance - Feb 2026."

The Data: Includes "Before" (Messy) and "After" (Clean) photos.

The Value: When selling, the homeowner proves: "This garage didn't have oil leaks or termites as of Feb 2026. Here is the photo proof stamped by uPYCK."

3. The "Home Warranty" Integration
This is where you make money without lifting a finger.

The Problem: Home Warranties (American Home Shield) deny claims constantly because they say, "You didn't maintain it."

The uPYCK Fix: "Warranty-Ready."

Strategy: You partner with a warranty company.

The Offer: "If you use uPYCK for your annual maintenance (labor), your Warranty Claim is Pre-Approved."

Why: You have the photo proof that the filter was changed. The warranty company trusts your data over the homeowner's word.

4. The "Renovation ROI" Tracker
Junk removal is often the first step of a renovation.

The Feature: When a user books "Demo/Debris Removal," the app asks: "Are you upgrading this Kitchen?"

The Calculation:

User: "Yes, new cabinets."

uPYCK: Logs the event. "Kitchen Demo Completed. Ready for Upgrades."

Result: The Home Score updates to reflect "Modernized Kitchen in Progress."

The Sell: You track the value added to the home, not just the cost of the junk.

5. Implementation: The "Property Profile" (Add this to Replit)
We need a new view for the customer: My Home's Resume.

A. Schema Update (shared/schema.ts):

TypeScript
export const propertyScore = pgTable("property_score", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey(),
  propertyId: uuid("property_id").references(() => properties.id),
  totalScore: integer("total_score").default(450), // Start at average
  safetyScore: integer("safety_score"), // Clutter/Hazards
  maintenanceScore: integer("maintenance_score"), // Recurring services
  efficiencyScore: integer("efficiency_score"), // Green/Eco
  lastUpdated: timestamp("last_updated").defaultNow()
});
B. The "Score Booster" Nudge (client/src/components/score-booster.tsx): A widget on the dashboard that says:

📉 Your Home Score dropped 5 points. Reason: No Water Heater Flush detected in 12 months. Action: Book a Pro ($89) to restore your score.

6. The "Insurance Discount" (The Holy Grail)
This is the ultimate end-state.

The Pitch to State Farm/Allstate: "Homes with a uPYCK Score of 700+ have 40% fewer fire/water claims because they are decluttered and maintained."

The Result: uPYCK users get a 5-10% discount on Homeowners Insurance.

The Lock-in: The customer cannot cancel uPYCK or hire a random guy, or their insurance rate goes up.

Summary
Stop selling "Junk Removal." Start selling "Asset Verification."

Gamify Maintenance. Give them a score. People hate losing points.

Prove the Value. Give them the "Resale Certificate" PDF.
