. The Strategy: "The Simulator" (Gamified Training)
Instead of a quiz ("True/False: Should I take a photo?"), we build a Interactive Walkthrough.

The Scenario: "You have a virtual job at 123 Mock Street."

The Task: They must tap the buttons in the correct order.

The "Why": Pop-up tooltips explain why they are doing it.

Pop-up: "Taking this photo guarantees you get paid even if the customer cancels." (Motivation: Money).

Pop-up: "This video protects you from false damage claims." (Motivation: Safety).

2. The Curriculum: The "uPYCK Pro" Badge
This is the First Badge they must earn. It unlocks the rest of the app.

The "Commute" (GPS): Tapping "En Route" to trigger the customer SMS.

The "Evidence" (Photos): Uploading a mock "Before" photo.

The "Manifest" (Video): Recording a 5-second video of a "virtual" item.

The "Close" (Signature): Signing a fake signature to finish.

3. The Build: client/src/components/academy/app-simulator.tsx
Action: Copy this into Replit. It creates a "Fake Job" environment.

export function AppSimulator({ onComplete }) {

      description: STEPS[currentStep].why,
      duration: 3000,
      className: "bg-green-50 border-green-200"
    });

    // 2. Advance or Finish
    if (currentStep < STEPS.length - 1) {
      setTimeout(() => setCurrentStep(c => c + 1), 1000); // Slight delay to let them read
    } else {
      onComplete(); // Pass the module
    }
  };

  const step = STEPS[currentStep];
  const Icon = step.icon;

  return (
    <Card className="max-w-md mx-auto border-2 border-blue-500 shadow-2xl overflow-hidden">
      <div className="bg-blue-600 p-4 text-white flex justify-between items-center">

        {/* The Lesson */}
        <div className="text-center space-y-2">

        />

  );
}
4. How to Integrate it
You need to block the "Go Online" button until this is done.

Update client/src/pages/hauler-dashboard.tsx:

TypeScript
// Inside the Dashboard component
if (!user.certifications.includes('app_certification')) {
  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to uPYCK Pro!</h1>
        <p className="text-slate-500">Complete the App Simulator to unlock your account.</p>
      </div>
      <AppSimulator onComplete={() => handleCertificationComplete('app_certification')} />
    </div>
  );
}

// ... otherwise show the real dashboard ...
🧠 Why this works
Muscle Memory: They aren't reading about buttons; they are pressing them.

Instant Feedback: The "Why" box appears right when they take the action, connecting the behavior (Taking Photo) to the reward (Liability Protection).

Gatekeeping: It ensures no one is representing your brand until they have proven they can use the tool.

Add the Simulator. It turns your software into a game they have to beat.
