. The Homepage Hero (The "Face Lift")Current: A generic "Professional moving truck" image with a "Select Your Items" dropdown.Fix: Replace with the "Command Center" code we wrote.Add: The "Live Map" showing active Pyckers in Orlando.Add: The "Live ETA" (e.g., "Arrives by 10:45 AM").Add: The new Dropdown with Pressure Washing and Gutter Cleaning.2. The Service Menu (The "Unlicensed 5")Current: It lists "Furniture Moving" and "Truck Unloading" as separate main services.Fix: Consolidate and Expand.Merge: "Moving" and "Unloading" $\rightarrow$ "Moving Helpers ($90/hr)".Add: Pressure Washing ($0.25/sqft).Add: Gutter Cleaning ($149 Flat).Add: Home Health Audit ($49).Why: You are leaving money on the table. A customer booking a garage cleanout ($299) needs a pressure wash ($99) immediately after. The current site doesn't offer it.3. The "Why" Section (The "Sticky" Factor)Current: "Lower Cost. Faster Service." (Commodity language).Fix: Replace with the "Asset Management" features.Insert: "The uPYCK Home Score™" (Explaining resale value).Insert: "Digital Inventory" (Explaining the free asset scan).Insert: "The Green Promise" (Explaining tax receipts).Why: If you compete on "Lower Cost" (like the current site says), you lose to a guy with a pickup truck. You must compete on Data & Tech.4. The Pricing Page (The Math)Current: Shows a confusing table comparing you to "Others" with "$79 min vs $129 min."Fix: Remove the "Race to the Bottom" comparison.New Logic: "AI-Verified Pricing."Junk: Volume-based (1/8 truck, 1/4 truck).Washing: Square footage based.Gutters: Flat rate (1-story vs 2-story).Crucial: Remove the "$1/mile" for moving. That will bankrupt you on short heavy moves. Switch to Hourly Labor.5. The "Become a Pycker" PageCurrent: "Own a truck? Join our network."Fix: This alienates 50% of your workforce.Update: "Have a Truck? Have a Pressure Washer? Or just Strong Arms?"Add: The Career Ladder (Rookie $\rightarrow$ Specialist $\rightarrow$ Consultant).Add: The Pay Table we designed ($45/hr for labor, $150+ for jobs).
