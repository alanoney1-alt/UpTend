o "push" all of this to Replit tonight means moving from a plan to a working, hosted environment that your debugger can access tomorrow.

Here is your Final Sprint Checklist to ensure Upyck is "live" and ready for your debugger.

1. The Environment Setup (The Foundation)
You need to make sure your Replit Workspace has all the "organs" it needs to function.

Secrets (Environment Variables):

Open the Tools menu on the left and select Secrets (padlock icon).

Add placeholders (or real keys if you have them) for:

DATABASE_URL (Auto-filled if using Replit PostgreSQL)

GEMINI_API_KEY (For the Greenproof Agent)

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (For payouts)

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID & TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN (For SMS)

Replit PostgreSQL:

Go to Tools > PostgreSQL. Click Setup Database.

This will give you a live DB. Your debugger will love that they don't have to set up a local database.

2. The "Agent Push" (Executing the Build)
Since you want this "all the way built out," give the Replit Agent a massive, final instruction. Paste this into the Agent chat:

"Assemble the Upyck Core tonight. I need the following structure:

Database Schema: Initialize the users, workers, jobs, and esg_impact_logs tables we discussed.

Auth & Safety Gate: Create a middleware that requires workers to be 'active' before accepting jobs.

The Race Condition Logic: Implement the /api/jobs/accept route using a SQL transaction and FOR UPDATE lock.

Uber-Style Tracking: Set up a Socket.io server to handle updateLocation from workers and workerLocation to customers.

Greenproof Engine: Create a service that calculates CO2 savings and landfill diversion for every completed job.

Dashboard Scaffolding: Create a 'Worker Command Center' with status toggles and a 'Customer Tracking View' with a placeholder map."

3. The "Debugger Handover" (Documentation)
To make sure the person you hired tomorrow doesn't waste time, create a file in the root directory called README_DEBUGGER.md. Put this inside:

Markdown
# Upyck Debugger Notes - Feb 7, 2026
**Current Status:** Architecture and Core Logic Pushed.
**Key Areas to Verify:**
1. **SMS Webhooks:** Test the Twilio 'Reply 1 to Accept' logic in `/api/sms/incoming`.
2. **Race Condition:** Verify only one worker can accept a job using the SQL Lock.
3. **Socket.io Flow:** Ensure worker GPS updates are successfully broadcasting to the customer's room.
4. **ESG Logic:** Test the CO2 calculator for a 20-mile move with a 'large' truck.
4. How to "Save" Your Work (Git)
Even if you aren't using GitHub yet, use Replit's built-in Git Tool (the branch icon) to save a "Checkpoint." * Commit Message: "Final pre-debug build: Upyck Core + Greenproof Agent logic."

This allows you to "Roll Back" if the debugger accidentally breaks something tomorrow.
