How to prompt the Replit Agent:

"I am building a home services app. Create a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database. Create a 'Workers' table with columns for: id, name, email, status (default: 'pending'), stripe_identity_id, and background_check_status. Add an endpoint /api/onboard-worker that triggers a Stripe Identity verification session."

🛠️ Step 3: Setting Up Webhooks
Since background checks and ID verifications aren't instant, you need Webhooks. This is how the external API "calls" your Replit app to say, "Hey, Mike just passed his check!"

Code Snippet for your Replit Webhook Handler:

JavaScript
app.post('/api/webhooks/checkr', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  // If the background check is completed and "clear"
  if (event.type === 'report.completed' && event.data.object.status === 'clear') {
    const workerId = event.data.object.external_id;
    
    // Update worker status in your Replit DB
    await db.query('UPDATE workers SET background_check_status = $1 WHERE id = $2', ['clear', workerId]);
    
    console.log(`Worker ${workerId} is now safety-cleared!`);
  }
  res.status(200).send('Webhook Received');
});
🤖 How to make the site & processes more "Auto"?
Since you are on Replit, you can use Replit Deployments to keep your "Auto-Agents" running 24/7. Here are three "Auto" features to add:

The Auto-Follow Up (Customer Side):

If a customer starts a booking but doesn't finish, have an AI agent (using a Cron Job in Replit) send a text 30 minutes later: "Hey! I saw you were looking for a garage cleanout. Do you have a photo of the junk? I can give you an instant quote now."

The Auto-Dispatcher (Worker Side):

Instead of you manually assigning jobs, build a script that runs every time a new job is posted. It should calculate the distance between the job and all active workers and "ping" the closest three first.

The Auto-Review Harvester:

1 hour after the AI detects the "Unloading" job is finished (via GPS), it automatically texts the customer a link to leave a 5-star review. This builds your SEO while you sleep.

Next Step for You:
Go to your Replit project and open the Agent chat. Give it this prompt to start the foundation:

"Help me integrate the Stripe Identity API. Create a route that generates a verification link for a user and a webhook to receive the results."
