                A few years ago, I looked at the home services industry and saw a massive gap between the 
                promises made and the results delivered. Whether you were a homeowner, a renter, or a pro in a truck, 
                everybody was losing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I saw homeowners struggling to prove the value of their property to insurance companies. 
                I saw renters losing security deposits over things they didn't do. And I saw high-quality pros 
                getting squeezed by "gig" apps that treated them like commodities.

                I knew there had to be a way to build intelligence and accountability into the process.

2. Replit Implementation Checklist
To make sure these changes stick and don't conflict, follow this order:

Step 1: Replace the Logo Globaly
Open client/src/components/ui/logo.tsx. Delete the old uPYCK code and paste the UpTend Logo code (the one with the Blue/Cyan gradient and the Arrow-U). This will fix the header, footer, and login screens instantly.

Step 2: Update the Main App Entry (client/src/App.tsx)
Ensure your router knows about the new pages. Your Switch should look like this:

TypeScript
<Switch>
  <Route path="/" component={LandingPage} />
  <Route path="/about" component={OurStory} />
  <Route path="/become-pro" component={BecomePro} />
  <Route path="/academy" component={AcademySyllabus} />
  <Route path="/services/audit" component={HomeAudit} />
  <Route path="/services/junk" component={JunkRemoval} />
  {/* ... other routes ... */}
</Switch>
Step 3: Rebuild the Landing Page (client/src/pages/landing-page.tsx)
This is the "Face" of the company. It should import the new components you just made:

TypeScript
import { Hero } from "@/components/home/hero"; // Update with new tagline
import { HowItWorksPillars } from "@/components/home/how-it-works-pillars";
import { ImpactWidget } from "@/components/dashboard/impact-widget";
// ... imports

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Hero /> {/* Ensure hero uses: "Home intelligence. Instant service. Proven sustainability." */}
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-12">
         <ImpactWidget /> {/* Shows the live sustainability/value stats */}
      </div>
      <HowItWorksPillars /> {/* The Protect/Connect/Sustain grid */}
      {/* ... rest of page */}
    </main>
  );
}
Step 4: Final Metadata Check (client/index.html)
Change the <title> from uPYCK to UpTend | Home Intelligence & Protection. This is what people see in their browser tabs.

🚀 Why this works for Replit
Replit's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) will pick up these changes immediately. By splitting the logic into Pillars, Story, and Impact, you’ve created a "clean" codebase that looks like a professional SaaS startup rather than a basic gig-app.

One final reminder: In the Footer, ensure you have the line "UpTend is a registered trade name of uPYCK Inc." This keeps your legal corporation (uPYCK Inc.) safe while you market the beautiful UpTend brand.
