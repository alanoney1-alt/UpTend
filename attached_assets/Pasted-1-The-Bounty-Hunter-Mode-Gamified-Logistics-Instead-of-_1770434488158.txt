1. The "Bounty Hunter" Mode (Gamified Logistics)
Instead of just "dispatching" jobs, turn your hardest jobs into high-value bounties.

The Problem: Nobody wants to drive 45 minutes for a single couch pickup at 5:00 PM on a Friday.

The uPYCK Fix: Implement Dynamic Surge Pricing for Workers.

Feature: "Bounty Jobs." If a job sits in the queue for >5 minutes, the app automatically adds a "+$10 Bonus" badge. If it sits for 10 minutes, it becomes "+$20."

Why: It ensures 100% fulfillment without you having to manually call drivers and beg. The market clears itself.

Tech: A simple cron job in matching-timer.ts that increments a bonus_amount column in the database.

2. "Visual Inventory" for Insurance Claims (The Trojan Horse)
You are already taking photos of everything in the house. That data is valuable to insurance companies.

The Problem: When a hurricane hits Orlando, homeowners struggle to prove what they owned.

The uPYCK Fix: "The uPYCK Vault."

Feature: Offer customers a "Digital Home Inventory" report for free after a move/cleanout. "We noticed you moved a 65-inch Sony TV and a Peloton. Here is a timestamped PDF proof of ownership for your home insurance."

Why: It makes you "sticky." Customers won't delete the app because it holds their insurance proof.

Tech: Use the existing ai-analysis.ts to tag items (Brand, Model, Condition) and save it to a new inventory_reports table.

3. The "Reseller Marketplace" (eBay Automation)
Right now, you are paying workers to dump things. Why not let them sell it?

The Problem: A PYCKER picks up a perfectly good dining table. They dump it because they don't have time to list it on Facebook Marketplace.

The uPYCK Fix: "One-Click Resell."

Feature: The AI already identified the item as "Dining Table, Good Condition." Add a button for the PYCKER: "Post to Marketplace."

Automation: The app auto-generates a title, description, and price based on the photo. The PYCKER just hits "Post."

Revenue: You take a small "listing fee" or just let the worker keep the profit as a massive retention perk. "Work for uPYCK, find free inventory."

4. "Smart Lock" Integration (The Invisible Service)
Property managers hate meeting haulers to unlock doors.

The Problem: "Can you be there between 12 and 4?" (The property manager has to sit in an empty house for 4 hours).

The uPYCK Fix: Integration with SmartRent / Latch / August.

Feature: "Digital Keys." When a Property Manager books a job, they grant a "One-Time Access Code" valid only for the duration of the job.

Why: This is the killer feature for B2B. You tell a large apartment complex: "You never have to meet our drivers. Our app unlocks the unit, we clean it, we lock it, we leave."

Tech: API integrations with major smart lock providers (start with a simple "Access Code" field in the booking flow that is encrypted and only revealed to the driver upon arrival).

5. The "Carbon Offset" Upsell (Free Money)
Corporate clients have sustainability budgets they need to spend.

The Problem: Companies have net-zero goals but don't know how to reach them.

The uPYCK Fix: "Green Tier" Booking.

Feature: Add a checkbox at checkout: "Make this job Carbon Neutral for +$4.99?"

Execution: You take the $4.99, buy certified carbon credits (which cost like $1.00), and pocket the difference while giving the client a "Green Certified" badge for their ESG report.

Why: It increases Average Order Value (AOV) with zero operational work.

Summary: The "Hell Yes" Features
Bounty Mode: Solves the "Friday at 5 PM" problem.

Insurance Vault: Turns a one-time service into a lifetime utility.

Reseller Tool: Turns trash into cash for your workers (retention).

Smart Access: The ultimate B2B convenience.

Carbon Upsell: Pure margin from corporate guilt.
