This is the most critical operational guardrail. If you treat these "Consultants" like employees (training them, giving them uniforms, setting their schedule), the IRS will reclassify them as W-2, and you will owe millions in back taxes.

To keep them as 1099 Independent Contractors, you must structure the relationship around "Results," not "Control."

Here is the "Safe Harbor" Protocol for hiring and dispatching Home Consultants.

1. The Role: "Field Data Collector" (Not "Inspector")
Do not hire "Home Inspectors." That implies a licensed, regulated employee role. Hire "Field Data Collectors" or "estimators."

The Deal: "We pay you $25 to go to this address, capture a video scan, and fill out a checklist. How you get there and what tools you use are up to you."

The Deliverable: You are buying a Data Packet (The Video + The List). You are not buying their time.

2. The "3-Point" Legal Shield
To pass the IRS test, build these rules into the app:

Rule 1: No Equipment Provided (Financial Control).

They must use their own smartphone.

They must use their own vehicle.

Why: If you give them an iPad and a company car, they are employees.

Rule 2: The "Right to Reject" (Behavioral Control).

They must be able to see a consultation request and decline it without being fired.

App Logic: Show it as an "Opportunity," not an "Assignment."

Rule 3: Paid on "Output," Not "Hour" (Relationship).

Never pay hourly for this.

Pay Structure: Flat Fee ($25 per completed Report).

Why: If they take 2 hours to do a 30-minute job, that's their problem. If they do it in 15 minutes, they win. This is the definition of a contractor.

🛠️ Technical Implementation: The "Certification" Gate
You can't just let any junk hauler do this. They need to be "qualified." But you can't "train" them (training = employee). The Loophole: You offer a "Voluntary Certification Badge."

1. Schema Update (shared/schema.ts)
We need to track who has "unlocked" the ability to see these high-paying gigs.

TypeScript
// shared/schema.ts

export const haulerCertifications = pgTable("hauler_certifications", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  haulerId: varchar("hauler_id").notNull(),
  
  // The Badge
  type: varchar("type").default('home_estimator'), // 'home_estimator', 'heavy_machinery'
  isActive: boolean("is_active").default(true),
  earnedAt: timestamp("earned_at").defaultNow(),
  
  // Quality Score specific to this role
  accuracyRating: integer("accuracy_rating").default(100), // 0-100
});
2. The "University" Screen (Worker App)
Instead of "Training," call it "Earn Your Badge."

Video: "How to take a perfect 360-degree room scan."

Quiz: "What do you do if you see a pile of tires?"

Result: If they pass, they unlock the "Consultation" job type in their feed.

3. The "Gig Offer" Logic (server/services/dispatch.ts)
When a customer books a $49 Consult, the algorithm only sends it to workers with the home_estimator badge.

TypeScript
// server/services/dispatch.ts

export async function dispatchConsultation(consultId: string, lat: number, lng: number) {
  // 1. Find qualified 1099 contractors nearby
  const qualifiedHaulers = await db.select().from(haulers)
    .innerJoin(haulerCertifications, eq(haulers.id, haulerCertifications.haulerId))
    .where(and(
      eq(haulerCertifications.type, 'home_estimator'), // MUST have badge
      eq(haulerCertifications.isActive, true),
      // ... geo logic ...
    ));

  // 2. Broadcast the "Gig"
  for (const hauler of qualifiedHaulers) {
    sendPushNotification(hauler.id, {
      title: "New Assessment Gig: $25.00",
      body: "30-min data collection. Located 5 miles away.",
      action: "accept_gig",
      payout: 2500 // $25.00
    });
  }
}
4. The "Uniform" Loophole
You want them to look professional, but you can't force them to wear a uniform (that's an employee trait).

The Solution: "Merch Store."

Logic: Sell them a "uPYCK Pro" polo shirt for $15.

The Nudge: "Pros who wear branded gear get 20% higher tips and better ratings."

Result: They choose to buy and wear it. You stay legal.

Summary of the "Consultant" Economics
Customer Pays: $49.00

Worker Pays (Cost of Goods): $0.00 (Uses own phone).

Worker Gets: $25.00 (Flat Fee).

uPYCK Gross Margin: $24.00 (50% Margin).

Upside: If they sell a $500 junk job during the consult, give them a **10% Commission ($50)**.

This incentivizes them to be "Salespeople" without you managing them.

Add the haulerCertifications table now. This allows you to filter your workforce and only send these delicate jobs to your "Top 10%" rated workers.
