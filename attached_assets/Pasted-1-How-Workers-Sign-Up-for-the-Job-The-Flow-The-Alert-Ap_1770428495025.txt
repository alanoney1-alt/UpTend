1. How Workers Sign Up for the Job (The Flow)The Alert (App/Web): Use Socket.io. When a customer posts a job, the server emits an event to all "Active" workers in that category. A popup appears on their Upyck dashboard with a "View Job" button.The Alert (SMS): Simultaneously, Twilio sends a text: "New $150 Junk Removal nearby! View & Accept here: [Link]".The Landing Page: The link takes them to a "Job Detail" page where they see the items, the ESG potential, and the payout.2. How to Build "The Accept" (The Logic)You need to ensure that the job status changes instantly so no two people can "win" the same work.Replit Agent Prompt for the Accept Logic:"In my Node.js app, create a POST route /api/jobs/:id/accept.Use a PostgreSQL Transaction to ensure atomicity.The logic should be: UPDATE jobs SET worker_id = $1, status = 'accepted' WHERE id = $2 AND status = 'pending'.If the update affects 1 row, send a success message. If 0 rows (meaning someone else grabbed it), return an error: 'This job is no longer available.'After success, send a WebSocket alert to the customer: 'A Pycker is on the way!'"3. How to Build the "Auto-Matching" (The Uber Brain)Instead of texting every worker in the city, the AI should "Ripple" the job out.Step 1: Ping the 5 closest workers with the highest "Green Rating."Step 2: If no one accepts in 2 minutes, the AI automatically pings the next 10 closest workers.Step 3: The AI continues until the job is filled.Tell the Replit Agent to build this "Ripple" Dispatcher:"Create a background worker using node-cron. Every 2 minutes, it should find all 'pending' jobs. For each job, identify the nearest 5 workers who haven't been notified yet and trigger the sendJobAlert function (SMS + Socket). Stop when the job is 'accepted'."4. Implementation in Replit (The Tech Stack)FeatureToolWhy?Real-time App Alertssocket.ioIt pushes the "Job Available" popup to their phone screen instantly.SMS NotificationstwilioFor workers who don't have the app open or are "on the road."Geo-MatchingPostGIS (or simple Lat/Long math)Calculates which workers are within 5–10 miles of the job.Race Condition SafetySQL UPDATE with WHERE status = 'pending'Ensures only one person can successfully click "Accept."5. Summary of the "Simplified" Worker ProcessNotification: Phone pings (SMS + App Alert).Review: Worker taps the alert, sees the "Green Impact" and the Pay.Accept: One-tap "Accept" button.Confirmation: Instant screen change to "Navigation to Customer."
