A. Schema Update (shared/schema.ts)
We treat the property_address as a unique entity.

TypeScript
// shared/schema.ts

export const properties = pgTable("properties", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey(),
  addressHash: varchar("address_hash").unique(), // Anonymized until claimed
  fullAddress: text("full_address"),
  ownerId: varchar("owner_id"), // Current uPYCK user
  
  // The "Carfax" Score
  maintenanceScore: integer("maintenance_score").default(0), // 0-100
  lastAssessmentDate: timestamp("last_assessment_date"),
  
  // Value Creation
  estimatedValueIncrease: integer("estimated_value_increase").default(0), // Value added by uPYCK services
});

export const propertyEvents = pgTable("property_events", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey(),
  propertyId: uuid("property_id").references(() => properties.id),
  serviceRequestId: varchar("service_request_id"), // Link to the job
  eventType: varchar("event_type"), // 'repair', 'maintenance', 'upgrade', 'inspection'
  description: text("description"), // "AC Capacitor Replaced"
  verifiedBy: varchar("verified_by"), // "Pro: Mike's HVAC (License #123)"
  photosBefore: jsonb("photos_before"),
  photosAfter: jsonb("photos_after"),
  date: timestamp("date").defaultNow(),
  isTransferable: boolean("is_transferable").default(true) // Can be given to buyer
});
3. The "QR Code" Sticker Strategy (The Viral Loop)
This is how you get physical lock-in.

The Tactic: Every time a uPYCK Pro services an AC unit, Water Heater, or Electrical Panel, they stick a uPYCK QR Code on it.

The User Experience:

Homebuyer walks into a house.

Scans the QR code on the Water Heater.

Popup: "uPYCK Certified: Flushed Jan 2026. Installed 2024. Warranty Valid."

The Moat: The new owner must download the uPYCK app to "Claim Ownership" of this history. You acquire the new customer for $0.

4. The "Zillow" Integration (The Exit Strategy)
Eventually, you build an API specifically for Zillow/Redfin.

The Feature: A "Verified Maintenance" badge on Zillow listings.

The API:

JSON
GET /api/property/public-report?address=123_Main_St
{
  "badge": "uPYCK Gold Certified",
  "maintenance_score": 94,
  "last_major_service": "Roof Inspection (Passed) - Oct 2025",
  "verified_value_add": "+$12,500 in documented upgrades"
}
Why Zillow Pays You: Listings with this badge sell 30% faster. Zillow will pay you millions to access this data layer.

5. How to Launch It (The MVP)
You don't need Zillow yet. You just need to give the homeowner a PDF they can hand to a buyer.

Add a "Generate Report" button to the Customer Dashboard.

Action: It compiles all their jobs (Junk Removal, Moving, Cleaning) into a sleek PDF titled: "Official Property Maintenance Record."

The Copy: "Selling your home? Download your uPYCK Report to prove to buyers your home is well-maintained. Users report selling for 2-5% higher."

🚀 Immediate Action for Debugger
To start capturing this value today, we just need to ensure we aren't throwing away the data.

Create the properties table. (Shift from User-Centric to Address-Centric data).

Tag Every Job: In routes.ts, when a job is completed, automatically create a property_event entry.

The "Transfer" Button: Add a feature in the User Profile: "Moving? Transfer this Home History to the new owner."
