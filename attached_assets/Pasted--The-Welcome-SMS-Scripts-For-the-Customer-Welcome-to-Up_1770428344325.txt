. The "Welcome SMS" Scripts
For the Customer:

"Welcome to Upyck! 🏠 Your account is active. We’ll text you when your Pro is on the way and send your 'Green Receipt' after the job. Reply STOP to opt out."

For the Pycker (Worker):

"Welcome to the Upyck Pro Team! 🚚 You’re now eligible for jobs. We’ll text you the moment a new request hits your area. Reply STOP to opt out."

2. How to Tell the Replit Agent to Build It
Open the Replit Agent chat and paste this exact prompt:

"I need to add a TCPA-compliant 'Welcome SMS' flow to my signup process.

Use the Twilio SDK for Node.js.

Create a new file called services/sms.js with a function sendWelcomeSMS(phone, role).

In the signup route, after a user is saved to the PostgreSQL database, trigger this function.

Ensure the signup form has a mandatory checkbox for 'Consent to receive automated texts and calls' and save the ip_address and timestamp of this consent to the user's record."

3. The Replit "Secrets" (Manual Step)
The Agent can't see your private Twilio keys, so you must add them manually:

Go to the Tools section on the left sidebar in Replit.

Click on Secrets (the lock icon).

Add these three keys:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER (The number you bought on Twilio).

4. The Backend Logic (What the Agent will write)
The code the Agent generates will look something like this. It ensures that the Welcome Text is the very first thing they receive, serving as their "Confirmation of Opt-In."

JavaScript
// services/sms.js
const twilio = require('twilio');
const client = new twilio(process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN);

async function sendWelcomeSMS(phone, role) {
  const message = role === 'pycker' 
    ? "Welcome to Upyck Pro! 🚚 You're ready for jobs. We'll text you new requests. Reply STOP to opt out."
    : "Welcome to Upyck! 🏠 We'll text you when your Pro is on the way. Reply STOP to opt out.";

  try {
    await client.messages.create({
      body: message,
      from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
      to: phone
    });
    console.log(`Welcome SMS sent to ${phone}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("SMS Error:", error);
  }
}
5. Why this beats the "Big Companies"
Most big companies have a delay between signup and their first communication. By using Replit to trigger this instantly, you are:

Legally Protected: You have a timestamped record of their consent and the confirmation text sent.

Psychologically Engaging: The customer/worker gets a "ping" the moment they join, making Upyck feel "Live" and "Immediate" (the Uber effect).
