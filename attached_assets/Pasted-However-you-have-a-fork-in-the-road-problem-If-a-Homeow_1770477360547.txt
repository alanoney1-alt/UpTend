However, you have a fork in the road problem.If a Homeowner clicks "The Academy," they want to see why your people are safe (The "Trust" Pitch).If a Worker clicks "The Academy," they need to log in and start training (The "LMS" Dashboard).Right now, if you just link it to the login screen, you scare away customers. If you link it to a marketing page, you annoy workers.Here is the "Split-Path" Flow you need to build to handle both audiences gracefully.1. The "Academy Landing Page" (Public)URL: /academy (Public)Goal: Sell the standard to customers, and provide the door for workers.👉 Action: Create client/src/pages/academy/public-landing.tsx.The Hero Section: "We Don't Hire Backgrounds. We Certify Futures." (High-level branding).The "Trust" Section (For Homeowners):Show the badges: "Ladder Safety Certified," "Background Checked," "Insured."Headline: "Why a uPYCK Pro is safer than a guy from Craigslist."The "Worker" Section (For Pyckers):Headline: "Earn Your Badge. Unlock Higher Pay."Button: "Student Login / Start Training" (Links to /academy/dashboard).2. The "Gatekeeper" Logic (Redirects)You need to protect the actual training content so only logged-in workers can see it.👉 Action: Update client/src/App.tsx (Router Logic).TypeScript// Inside your Switch / Routes
<Route path="/academy" component={AcademyPublicLanding} /> 

// PROTECTED ROUTE (The Real Academy)
<ProtectedRoute 
  path="/academy/dashboard" 
  component={AcademyDashboard} 
  allowRole="hauler" // Only workers allowed
/>
3. The "Badge Verifier" (The Public Proof)This is the "Killer Feature" for the Public Academy page. Allow customers to verify a badge they see in real life.👉 Action: Add a small tool on the public page: "Verify a Pro".Input: "Enter Badge ID (e.g., PYCK-492)"Output: "✅ Verified: Mike S. is Active and Certified in Gutter Cleaning."Why this wins:Customers feel incredibly safe knowing they can "audit" you.Workers feel proud (and accountable) because their badge is "live."🚀 Summary of the FlowUser Clicks "The Academy" on Navbar.Goes to /academy (Public Page).Customer thinks: "Wow, they have a real curriculum. This is a legit company."Worker thinks: "Where do I sign in?" $\rightarrow$ Clicks "Student Login."Worker Logs In.Redirects to /academy/dashboard (Private).They see their progress bars, videos, and quizzes.Build the Public Landing Page first. It turns your internal training into an external marketing asset.
