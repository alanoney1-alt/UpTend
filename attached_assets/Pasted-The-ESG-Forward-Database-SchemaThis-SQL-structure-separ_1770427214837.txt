The "ESG-Forward" Database SchemaThis SQL structure separates the Core Logistics (the job) from the ESG Metrics (the impact).Prompt for Replit Agent:"I am using Replit PostgreSQL. Create a database schema for 'Upyck' with the following tables:users (id, name, email, home_health_score)workers (id, name, status, green_rating, skills_json)jobs (id, user_id, worker_id, service_category, status, carbon_estimated, carbon_actual)esg_impact_logs (id, job_id, metric_type [e.g., 'CO2_SAVED', 'WASTE_DIVERTED'], value, unit, verification_source)tax_credit_claims (id, user_id, job_id, credit_type, estimated_amount, filing_status)Add foreign keys to link jobs to users and workers, and esg_impact_logs to jobs."2. The Long-Term "Auto" Features from ProofGreenTo make Upyck "all the way built out," you should port these specific ProofGreen logics into your Replit app:A. The "Scope 3" Reporting APIIn 2026, corporate clients (like property managers) are legally required to report emissions from their vendors.The Logic: Every time a Pro completes a job, the AI calculates the "Net Impact" (Fuel used - Route optimization savings).The Feature: Add a button in the User Dashboard: "Export Annual Sustainability Report." This generates a PDF that corporate clients can hand directly to their auditors.B. The "Tax Credit" Eligibility EngineAs you expand to HVAC and Electrical, this becomes your biggest sales tool.The Logic: Use your Multi-Modal AI Intake to identify serial numbers or model types from photos.The Feature: If the AI sees an old R-22 AC unit, it flags the job as "High Priority for Upgrade" and calculates the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rebate (e.g., up to $2,000 for heat pumps) automatically.C. The "Circular Economy" TrackerFor Junk Removal and Garage Cleanouts, the "Manual Tax" is the cost of dumping everything in a landfill.The Logic: The AI categorizes junk into: Landfill, Metal (Scrap Value), Donation, or E-Waste.The Feature: The Worker App tells the Pro: "Drive 2 miles to the local metal recycler instead of 10 miles to the dump. You'll save $50 in fees and earn 10 Green Points."3. Implementation Sprint (Long-Term)If you want to build this out today, here is the order of operations in Replit:Phase 1 (Now): Moving & Junk Removal. Focus on Carbon Tracking (Distance $\times$ Truck Factor).Phase 2 (6 Months): Home Maintenance (HVAC/Plumbing). Focus on Tax Credit Identification (AI scanning equipment).Phase 3 (1 Year): The "Home Vault." Focus on Predictive ESG (Alerting homeowners when their "Home Health Score" drops).
