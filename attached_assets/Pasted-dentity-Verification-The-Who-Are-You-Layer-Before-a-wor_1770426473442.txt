dentity Verification: The "Who Are You?" Layer
Before a worker can accept a job, they must prove they are who they say they are.

Top Choice: Stripe Identity

Why: If you are already using Stripe for payments (which is recommended for an "Uber-style" app), this is a "one-click" integration. It uses AI to match a selfie to a government ID and detects deepfakes/spoofing.

Alternative: Sumsub or Onfido. These are powerful if you plan to expand internationally, as they support 2,000+ types of IDs globally.

2. Background Checks: The "Safety" Layer
You need a system that doesn't just check once but monitors your workers.

Top Choice: Checkr

Why: Checkr powers 95% of the gig economy (Uber, Lyft, Instacart). It is AI-driven, with 89% of checks returning in under one hour.

The "Forward" Feature: Use Checkr Continuous Monitoring. Instead of a yearly check, the AI alerts you instantly if a worker has a new legal issue (DUI, etc.), so you can pause their account automatically.

Cost: Roughly $29.99 for a Basic+ check (SSN trace, sex offender registry, global watchlist).

3. Insurance Verification: The "Liability" Layer
Since you’re doing moving and cleanouts, you must ensure your workers are insured.

Top Choice: Jones or TrustLayer

Why: These are "COI (Certificate of Insurance) Tracking" APIs.

The AI Workflow: The worker uploads a photo of their insurance paper. The AI (specifically Jones' AI) "reads" the document, checks the expiration date, ensures the coverage limits meet your requirements, and verifies that "Upyck" is listed as additionally insured.

The Result: If their insurance expires tomorrow, the AI agent automatically prevents them from accepting new jobs until they upload a new doc.

💻 The "Safety Engine" Code Logic
To build this, you want your backend to treat these as "Gates." A worker cannot move to the next step until the AI returns a status: "verified" response.

Example: The Onboarding Flow

Identity Gate: Worker submits ID via Stripe Identity SDK.

Safety Gate: Once Identity is confirmed, your backend triggers a Checkr API request using the worker's SSN and Name.

Insurance Gate: Worker uploads COI to TrustLayer API.

Activation: Only when all three webhooks return SUCCESS does the worker's status change to active in your database.

🚀 What else can be built for Customers and Workers?
Beyond safety, you can use AI to automate the Human Element of the business:

For Customers: AI "Damage Protection" (Visual Blockchain)
The Feature: Before the move starts, the customer must take a video of the room/items.

The AI: The AI tags every pre-existing scratch or dent.

The Value: This eliminates "he-said-she-said" disputes. If a customer claims a worker broke a TV, the AI pulls the "Before" video and checks the TV's status. It protects your workers from false claims and gives customers peace of mind.

For Workers: AI "Earnings Maximizer"
The Feature: A "Smart Tax" bot for the workers.

The AI: Since they are independent contractors, the AI tracks their mileage (via your app's GPS) and expenses.

The Value: At the end of the year, Upyck sends them a "Tax Ready" report. This makes workers loyal to your platform because you help them keep more of their money.

For the Marketplace: Dynamic "Surge" Pricing
The Feature: AI that analyzes weather and local events.

The AI: If there is a rainstorm predicted for Saturday, the AI knows that "Unloading" jobs will be in high demand (people want to get out of the rain fast).

The Value: It automatically raises the price for the customer and the payout for the worker, ensuring you have enough "Pros" on the road when it's busy.
