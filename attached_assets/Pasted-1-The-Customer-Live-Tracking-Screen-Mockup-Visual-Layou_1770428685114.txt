1. The Customer "Live Tracking" Screen Mockup
Visual Layout:

The Header: A persistent status bar. “Mike is 8 minutes away” (Updated in real-time).

The Map (Middle 60%): A full-bleed map using a clean, "light mode" style.

Icon A (Worker): A small truck or "U" logo icon that moves smoothly across the streets.

Icon B (Home): A fixed house icon representing the customer's location.

The Route: A thin, blue line connecting the two points.

The Footer (Bottom 30%): An expandable card with:

Worker Bio: Photo, name, and "Green Rating" (e.g., ⭐ 4.9 | 🍃 Eco-Certified).

The "Call/Text" Buttons: Large, easy-to-tap buttons for instant communication.

The ESG Tracker: A small live counter: "This route optimization has already saved 1.2kg of CO2."

2. How to Build the "Live Marker" in Replit
The secret to the "Uber" feel is smooth movement. You don't want the icon to "jump"; you want it to glide.

The Frontend Logic (Leaflet.js):

JavaScript
// Initialize the map
const map = L.map('map').setView([customerLat, customerLng], 15);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);

// Add the customer's house
L.marker([customerLat, customerLng], {icon: houseIcon}).addTo(map);

// Add the worker's moving marker
let workerMarker = L.marker([workerLat, workerLng], {icon: truckIcon}).addTo(map);

// Listen for Socket.io updates
socket.on('workerLocation', (data) => {
  // Use a plugin like Leaflet.Marker.SlideTo for smooth gliding
  workerMarker.slideTo([data.lat, data.lng], {
    duration: 2000,
    keepAtCenter: false
  });
  
  // Update the ETA and Distance text
  updateETADisplay(data.distance, data.duration);
});
3. Customer Safety & Professionalism Features
To beat the "Big Guys," you need to add the safety features they often skip:

The "Safety Code": Display a 4-digit code on the customer's screen. The worker must ask for this code before starting the job. This ensures the customer is letting the right person into their home.

Live ETA Ticker: Instead of "10:00 AM," show "Arriving in 7 minutes." This creates a sense of urgency and professionalism.

The "Proximity Alert": When the worker is 2 blocks away, the screen should pulse or change color with a message: "Mike is almost there! Please clear any obstacles from the driveway."

4. Why this fits the "Upyck + Greenproof" Vision
By showing the live map, you aren't just showing a truck—you are showing Efficiency in Motion. * If the worker takes a detour, the customer sees it.

If the AI reroutes the worker to avoid traffic (saving fuel), the customer sees the "Green Savings" counter go up.

Long Term: When you have all home services, this same screen works for the Plumber, the Electrician, and the Cleaner.

Final Task for Tonight:
Go to your Replit project and ask the Agent:

"Create a basic Leaflet.js map view for my customer tracking page. Use Socket.io to listen for 'workerLocation' events and move a marker on the map."
