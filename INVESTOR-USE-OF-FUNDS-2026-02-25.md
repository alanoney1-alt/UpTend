# PHASE 2: THE $400K RAISE — "Scale Orlando, Hire Key People" (Months 4-12)

**Goal: Dominate Orlando, hire CTO, prepare for Series A**

### CTO Hire — $80,000 (cash) + equity
| Detail | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| CTO salary (months 4-12, below-market + equity) | $80,000 |
| Equity allocation from ESOP | 3-5% vesting over 4 years |

**Why this works:** We're not paying Bay Area CTO rates ($250K+). We're offering $80K cash + 3-5% equity in a company with live product, paying customers, and clear growth trajectory. That's a compelling package for the right technical leader who wants to build something, not just collect a paycheck.

**CTO profile we're targeting:**
- Senior full-stack engineer (Node.js/React/React Native)

# WHY THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR YOUR NETWORK

### What's Already Built (normally costs $500K-1M)
- **Full platform live at uptendapp.com** — not a mockup, not a prototype
- **268 database tables**, 162 AI tools, 7 communication channels
- **George AI** — the most advanced home services AI assistant ever built
- **React Native app** scaffold ready for App Store
- **B2B system** — HOA, PM, construction, government pricing & onboarding
- **Home DNA Scan** — proprietary "Carfax for homes" product (potential billion-dollar IP)

### Competitive Advantages
1. **AI-first** — competitors (Thumbtack, Angi) are marketplaces with chatbots. George IS the product.
2. **Home DNA Scan** — proprietary interior home data no competitor has
3. **SDVOSB** — Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business certification (government contract access)
4. **Full-stack ownership** — not dependent on any third-party marketplace
5. **Multi-vertical from day one** — one HOA contract = revenue across 6+ services

### The Math
- Orlando metro: 1M+ households, $6.6B home services TAM
- Average job: $250 × 20% platform fee (15% pro + 5% customer) = **$50 gross margin per job**
- 1 HOA (200 units) = ~$5,000-15,000/month recurring across services
- 5 HOAs + direct consumers = **$50K+/month by month 9**
- Path to $1M ARR within 18 months of funding

### Exit Potential
- **Amazon** (#1 fit): Ring + Alexa + George + Home DNA = complete home flywheel
- **Zillow** (#2): Home DNA Scan data is exactly what they lack
- **Apple** (#3): HomeKit + George = the home intelligence layer they've never cracked
- Conservative acquisition range: **$25-60M with traction**
