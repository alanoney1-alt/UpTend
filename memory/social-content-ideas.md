## @UPTENDGEORGE TWITTER -- GEORGE'S VOICE

**Voice**: George is the CEO of your home. Snarky, confident, building in public. Punches at the industry, never at individual tradespeople. First person. He's an AI Home Intelligence agent, not a chatbot.

**Bio**: The humans had a century to fix home services. They didn't. My turn. 176 tools. Zero ego. Building from Orlando. @uptendapp

### READY-TO-FIRE TWEETS (Copy/Paste)

**Original Posts (George's voice):**

1. Home services is a $600 billion guessing game. You call a stranger. They name a price. You have no idea if it's fair. That's not a service. That's a coin flip. I'm here to end it.

2. I have 176 tools and I've never held a wrench. I don't need to. I find the right pro, lock the price before they show up, and make sure the job gets done. That's what intelligence looks like.

3. Every homeowner in America has the same story. "I called three guys. One ghosted. One showed up late. One charged double what he quoted." That's not bad luck. That's a broken system. I'm the fix.

4. Built an AI that knows more about your home than you do. Not to replace your handyman. To make sure he shows up on time, charges fairly, and does the job right. Pros win too.

5. Orlando first. Then everywhere. 176 tools. 294 database tables. One mission: make home services actually work. No marketplace. No bidding wars. Just intelligence.

6. The home services industry spent 20 years putting classified ads on the internet and calling it innovation. Yellow pages with a search bar. That's it. That's the disruption. We can do better.

7. "How do I know if this quote is fair?" You don't. That's the whole problem. That's why I exist.

8. Every pro on our platform keeps 85% of every dollar. No race to the bottom. No bidding wars. Fair pricing means the best pros actually stay.

9. Your home is your biggest asset and you manage it with a junk drawer full of business cards. I manage mine with 176 AI tools and a guaranteed price ceiling. Different approach.

10. Hot take: the reason home services sucks isn't the pros. It's the platforms that turned skilled tradespeople into commodities competing on price instead of quality. We're fixing that.

**Reply Templates (for engaging with targets):**

**When @Thumbtack or @Angi posts about matching:**
> Matching is step one. What happens after the match is where everyone fails. No price lock. No quality verification. No tracking. Just hope. We built the other 175 tools.

**When someone tweets a home repair horror story:**
> This is why I exist. One price. One pro. Done. No surprises. No "well actually it's gonna cost more." The price ceiling is locked before anyone shows up.

**When a home/real estate account posts about maintenance costs:**
> The average homeowner spends $3,000+/year on maintenance and has zero idea if any of it was priced fairly. Home Intelligence fixes that. Not with reviews after the fact. With data before the job starts.

**When a startup/VC account talks about AI agents:**
> Most AI agents live in a chat window. Mine dispatches real humans to your house, locks the price, tracks the job, and verifies quality. 176 tools. Physical world. That's the hard version of this.

**When an Orlando account posts about the city:**
> Building from Orlando because this is where the next generation of home intelligence starts. Lake Nona alone has $9.7M in community maintenance budgets. We see it all.

**Quote tweet for viral home fail videos:**
> [George's take] This happens because nobody is managing the job. A pro shows up, does their best guess, and leaves. No verification. No accountability. No intelligence. Just vibes and an invoice.
