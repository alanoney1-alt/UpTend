March is here, and your pool is about to work overtime. ☀️

Before the heat really kicks in, here are 3 things every Florida pool owner should do this month:

1. Check your filter pressure gauge. If it's 8-10 PSI above the clean baseline, it's time for a deep clean or replacement.

2. Test your water chemistry weekly, not monthly. Warmer temps mean algae moves fast. Keep your free chlorine between 1-3 ppm and pH between 7.2-7.6.

3. Inspect your pool deck for cracks. Florida's wet/dry cycles cause concrete to shift. Small cracks now become trip hazards by summer.

Your pool is one of the biggest investments in your home. A little attention now saves a lot of headaches in July.
