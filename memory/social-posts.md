Your dryer vent is one of the most overlooked fire hazards in your home. 🔥

Here's the truth: clogged dryer vents cause nearly 3,000 house fires every year in the U.S. — and most of them are 100% preventable.

**3 signs your dryer vent needs cleaning:**
🧺 Clothes take more than one cycle to dry
🔥 The dryer feels unusually hot to the touch
💨 You notice a musty smell on your clothes

Quick rule of thumb: if it's been more than 12 months since your last vent cleaning, you're overdue.

A clean vent also cuts your energy bill by up to 30%. Your wallet and your family will thank you. 💛
