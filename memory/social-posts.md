Your garage door is the largest moving part of your home — and most people never maintain it. 🏠

Here are 5 things to check this weekend:

🔧 Lubricate the rollers, hinges, and tracks with white lithium grease (NOT WD-40)
👁️ Inspect the weatherstripping along the bottom — cracked = energy loss + pests
⚖️ Test the balance: disconnect the opener and lift halfway. It should stay put. If it falls, the springs need adjusting.
🔄 Check the auto-reverse safety: place a 2x4 under the door and close it. It MUST reverse.
👂 Listen for grinding or scraping — that's metal-on-metal wear before something breaks.

A well-maintained garage door lasts 20-30 years. A neglected one? You'll know when the spring snaps at 6 AM on a Monday.

Stay ahead of it. 💪
