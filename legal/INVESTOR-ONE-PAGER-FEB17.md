## The Opportunity

**Workforce-as-a-Service.** AI is killing SaaS — but AI can't pressure wash a building, fix a roof, or maintain a 200-unit apartment complex. UpTend is the first platform where every job is tracked, every pro is verified, and every dollar is accounted for.

**Asking: $100K SAFE at $1M cap → ~10% ownership**
$35K raised to date from early believers.

A production-ready platform — **190+ database tables, live on Railway** — serving four verticals:

## Revenue Model

```
CONSUMER          7% customer fee + 20-25% pro fee (18% w/ certs)  → C-Corp
B2B / PM / HOA    $3-$10/door/month + 5-8% transaction fees       → C-Corp
CONSTRUCTION      Project fees + transaction fees                   → C-Corp
FREE TIER         $0/month, 7% transaction fee (≤10 properties)    → C-Corp
GOV'T (open bid)  Full contract revenue                             → C-Corp
GOV'T (SDVOSB)    30% licensing fee from LLC                        → C-Corp
```
**Every dollar touches the C-Corp.** The LLC is a narrow certification wrapper for SDVOSB-only deals.

**Why this matters:**
- **5 of 6 revenue channels** flow directly to the C-Corp (100%)
- The LLC is ONLY used for government contracts that **require** SDVOSB certification
- On SDVOSB contracts, the C-Corp still captures **30% via licensing fees**
- Open-bid government contracts go through the C-Corp directly
- **The C-Corp captures ~90 cents of every SDVOSB dollar and 100 cents of everything else**

## The Government Moat

**SDVOSB sole-source contracts up to $5M — zero competition.**

No bidding. No RFP. Direct award. This is federal law, not a loophole.

| | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gov't Revenue** | $300K | $1.5M | $3.5M |

*Government channel only. Consumer and B2B revenue is additive.*

Consumer cash flow funds government contract float — no separate working capital needed.

---

## 8 Competitive Moats

1. **SDVOSB certification** — sole-source up to $5M
2. **Pro certification gating** — only verified pros access B2B jobs
3. **AI-powered dispatch** — intelligent job matching and routing
4. **Double-entry accounting** — every dollar tracked, audit-ready
5. **Platform licensing structure** — captures revenue across all channels
6. **19 platform integrations** — deep ecosystem lock-in
7. **Government compliance engine** — WH-347, prevailing wage, audit trails
8. **Free tier adoption** — land-and-expand with small property managers
