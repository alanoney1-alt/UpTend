By using UpTend's Self-Serve Home DNA Scan feature ("Home DNA Scan"), you ("Customer") agree to the following Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use the Home DNA Scan feature.

---

## 1. Nature of Service — Not a Home Inspection

UpTend is **not** a licensed home inspector. The Home DNA Scan is an **informational tool only** and does not constitute a professional home inspection under Florida Statute §468.8311 or any other jurisdiction's licensing requirements.

The Home DNA Scan:
- Provides general observations about the visible condition of home systems and appliances based on customer-submitted photographs.
- Is **not a substitute** for a licensed home inspection, appraisal, engineering assessment, or any professional evaluation.
- Should **not** be relied upon for real estate transactions, insurance claims, legal proceedings, or any purpose requiring a certified inspection.

## 2. AI Analysis Disclaimer

UpTend uses artificial intelligence ("AI") to analyze photographs and estimate the age, condition, and remaining useful life of home systems and appliances.

- AI analysis is **assistive and not definitive**. All estimates are approximate.
- UpTend makes **no guarantees** regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated assessments, including but not limited to age estimates, condition ratings, maintenance recommendations, or remaining lifespan projections.
- AI analysis is limited to what is visible in submitted photographs and cannot detect hidden defects, structural issues, code violations, environmental hazards, or conditions not visible in images.

## 3. Customer Responsibility for Photo Accuracy

Customer is solely responsible for:
- The accuracy, quality, and completeness of all photographs submitted.
- Ensuring photographs accurately represent the current state of the property, systems, and appliances.
- Providing photographs of all relevant areas and systems for a comprehensive scan.

UpTend's analysis is only as good as the photos provided. Incomplete, blurry, misleading, or outdated photographs may result in inaccurate analysis. UpTend bears no responsibility for analysis errors caused by inadequate photo submissions.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

**UpTend is not liable for:**
- Issues, defects, or conditions not identified by the Home DNA Scan.

- Any decisions made by Customer based on Home DNA Scan data, including but not limited to purchasing, selling, repairing, or insuring a property.
- Property damage, personal injury, or financial loss arising from reliance on Home DNA Scan results.
- Third-party actions or omissions related to Home DNA Scan data.

**UpTend's total aggregate liability** arising from or related to the Home DNA Scan shall not exceed the total value of credits earned by Customer through the Home DNA Scan feature. This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise).

## 5. Credits & Rewards

- Home DNA Scan credits and rewards have **no cash value** and are **non-transferable**.
- Credits may only be applied toward UpTend services.
