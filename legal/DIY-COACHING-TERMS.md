By using UpTend's DIY Repair Coaching feature ("DIY Coaching"), including any guidance, instructions, or diagnostic assessments provided by George, UpTend's AI Assistant, you ("User") agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, do not use the DIY Coaching feature.

---

## 1. Informational Purposes Only

All DIY guidance, repair instructions, diagnostic assessments, and step-by-step coaching provided by George ("the AI Assistant") are for **informational and educational purposes only**. They do not constitute professional contracting, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, structural engineering, or any other form of licensed professional advice. No professional-client relationship is created by the use of DIY Coaching.

## 2. No Professional Representation

UpTend, UPYCK Inc., and the AI Assistant are **not** licensed contractors, electricians, plumbers, home inspectors, or engineers. The AI Assistant aggregates publicly available information, including manufacturer guidelines, publicly available repair tutorials, and general home maintenance knowledge. Nothing in the AI Assistant's output should be construed as a professional opinion, certification, or guarantee of any kind.

## 3. User Assumes All Risk

By choosing to perform any repair, maintenance, or modification to their property based on information provided by the AI Assistant, the User acknowledges and accepts **full responsibility** for:

(a) Their personal safety and the safety of all persons in the household or on the property;
(b) Any damage to property, appliances, systems, or structures;
(c) Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal building codes, zoning regulations, and permit requirements;
(d) Maintaining valid homeowner's insurance, renter's insurance, or other applicable coverage for their property;
(e) Any consequences, including but not limited to voided warranties, insurance claim denials, or code violations, arising from self-performed repairs.

## 4. Not a Substitute for Professional Service

The AI Assistant's guidance is **not a substitute** for hiring a licensed, insured professional. Users are strongly encouraged to consult qualified professionals for:

- Electrical work beyond basic fixture replacement (e.g., panel work, circuit additions, knob-and-tube remediation);
- Gas line or gas appliance repair of any kind;
- Structural modifications, including load-bearing walls, foundations, and framing;
- Roofing work on multi-story structures;
- Any work requiring permits under local building codes;
- Asbestos, lead paint, or mold remediation;
- Garage door spring or cable replacement;
- Tree removal near power lines;
- Any situation where the User feels uncertain, uncomfortable, or unsafe.

## 5. AI Limitations Acknowledged

The User acknowledges and agrees that:

(a) AI diagnostic assessments are **probabilistic, not definitive** — they represent the AI's best estimate based on available information and should not be treated as a professional diagnosis;
(b) Photo and video analysis may not capture all relevant conditions, including hidden damage, code violations, or environmental hazards;
(c) The AI cannot physically inspect, test, or verify conditions on the property;
(d) Recommendations are based on common scenarios and publicly available information, and may not account for unique property conditions, local code requirements, or manufacturer-specific procedures.

## 6. Safety Escalation

The AI Assistant includes safety warnings and may recommend professional service when it determines that a task poses significant risk. Users agree to:

(a) Follow all safety warnings provided by the AI Assistant;
(b) Immediately stop work if they encounter unexpected conditions (e.g., unusual wiring, gas odors, structural instability, water intrusion, mold, asbestos-suspect materials);
(c) Call emergency services (911) immediately for gas leaks, electrical fires, flooding, structural collapse, or any situation posing imminent danger to life or property;
(d) Not override, ignore, or attempt to circumvent safety escalation recommendations provided by the AI Assistant.

## 7. Third-Party Content

Tutorial videos, product recommendations, external links, and other third-party content referenced by the AI Assistant are provided by independent third parties (including but not limited to YouTube, retailer websites, and manufacturer portals). UpTend does not control, verify, endorse, or assume responsibility for the accuracy, safety, completeness, or legality of any third-party content. Use of third-party content is at the User's sole risk and subject to those parties' respective terms of service.

## 8. Product Recommendations

Product suggestions, price comparisons, and retailer links are provided for the User's convenience only. UpTend does not guarantee product availability, pricing accuracy, compatibility with the User's specific systems, or fitness for any particular purpose. Affiliate relationships may exist between UpTend and referenced retailers, and UpTend may receive compensation for purchases made through provided links. Such relationships do not influence the AI Assistant's safety recommendations.

## 9. Indemnification

User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UPYCK, Inc. d/b/a UpTend, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and the AI Assistant from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to:
