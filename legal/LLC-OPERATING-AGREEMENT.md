### Section 12.2 — Right of First Refusal

(a) If either Member (the "Selling Member") receives a bona fide written offer from a third party (the "Third-Party Offer") to purchase all or any portion of the Selling Member's Membership Interest and wishes to accept such offer, the Selling Member shall first give written notice to the other Member (the "Non-Selling Member") of the terms and conditions of the Third-Party Offer, including the identity of the proposed purchaser, the purchase price, and all other material terms.

(b) The Non-Selling Member shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to elect to purchase the Selling Member's Membership Interest on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Third-Party Offer.

(c) If the Non-Selling Member does not exercise the right of first refusal within the thirty (30) day period, UPYCK, Inc. shall have a secondary right of first refusal and shall have an additional thirty (30) days to elect to purchase the Selling Member's Membership Interest on the same terms and conditions.
