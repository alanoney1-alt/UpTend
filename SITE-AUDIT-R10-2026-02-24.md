## George Chat Test

**Prompt:** "Tell me about your services"

**Response quality:** Clean, professional, no emojis. Lists all 12 services with prices.

**Pricing inconsistencies vs. site:**

| Service | George Says | Site Says |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Pool Cleaning | $120/month | $99/month |
| Gutter Cleaning | $150+ | $129+ |
| Moving Labor | $80/hour | $65/hour per mover |
| Garage Cleanout | $299+ | $129+ (mini) |

These need to be synced.

## Global Issues Found

### Critical (blocks 10/10)
1. **Blog detail pages all 404** — /blog/when-to-replace-water-heater, /blog/junk-removal-cost-orlando, etc. All 9 posts link to dead pages.
2. **George pricing mismatches** — 4 services have wrong prices in chatbot vs. website.

### Medium
3. **"Home DNA Scan" in footer** — Appears twice in every page footer (under "Our Services" and under "For Pros"). The "For Pros" one links to /home-dna-scan. Decide: keep as branded feature or remove.
4. **Pricing page banner references "AI Home Scan"** — "You can scan your home for FREE" with link to /ai/home-scan. This was flagged as something to remove.
5. **Ana G. card shows "home_consultation" raw key** — /find-pro page, in her service tags.

### Minor
6. **Service detail redundant copy** — "Book your handyman services service today" on /services/handyman (likely templated across all service pages).
7. **No explicit price shown on service detail pages** — /services/handyman has no "$75/hr" visible; user must go to /pricing.

## Final Score: 8.5 / 10

The site has come a **long** way. Visually polished, professionally written, zero emojis, consistent footer, strong CTA placement, and excellent specialized pages (business, emergency, academy). Two big batches of improvements clearly landed.

## What's Left for 10/10

1. **Fix blog detail page routing** — all 9 posts are 404. This is the single biggest issue.
2. **Sync George's pricing** — update chatbot knowledge base for Pool ($99/mo), Gutter ($129+), Moving Labor ($65/hr), Garage Cleanout ($129+).
3. **Remove /ai/home-scan banner** from pricing page (or redirect it properly).
4. **Fix "home_consultation" raw key** in Ana G.'s /find-pro card.
5. **Fix service detail template** — "Book your [service] services service today" redundancy.
6. **(Optional)** Decide if "Home DNA Scan" stays in footer — it's a branded feature name, not "AI Home Scan", so arguably fine.
7. **(Optional)** Add pricing to service detail pages for better conversion.
8. **(Optional)** Mobile responsive spot-check.

Fix items 1-5 and this is a solid **9.5/10**. Add pricing to service detail pages and mobile polish for a clean **10/10**.
