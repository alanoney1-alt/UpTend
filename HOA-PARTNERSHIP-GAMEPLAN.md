# HOA Partnership Game Plan
## Prepared for Alan's Meeting — Feb 26, 2026

---

## The Two Core Models

### Model A: "HOA Pays" (Master Service Agreement)

**How it works:** The HOA signs a contract with UpTend as their service provider. The HOA pays for all services. Homeowners don't pay anything directly.

**Sub-options within Model A:**

**A1. UpTend + One Partner Company**
- HOA contracts with UpTend
- We subcontract ONE small business to handle all verticals
- That company staffs up or subs out as needed
- UpTend provides the tech layer: scheduling, tracking, documentation, compliance

*Pros:*
- Single point of accountability for the HOA
- Simpler billing (one invoice)
- The partner company gets guaranteed recurring revenue
- Easier quality control (one relationship to manage)

*Cons:*
- Hard to find one company that does everything well
- If that company fails, you lose the whole contract
- Less competitive pricing (no per-vertical optimization)

*Best for:* Smaller HOAs (under 100 units) that want simplicity

**A2. UpTend + Multiple Specialist Partners**
- HOA contracts with UpTend
- We assign different small businesses per vertical (landscaper for landscaping, pool company for pools, etc.)
- UpTend orchestrates everything: scheduling, routing, quality, payments

*Pros:*
- Best-in-class service per vertical
- If one vendor underperforms, swap them without disrupting the whole contract
- Competitive pricing per vertical
- More pros earning income through the platform

*Cons:*
- More vendor relationships to manage (but that's what our dashboard solves)
- Slightly more complex billing
- Need a deep enough pro network per vertical

*Best for:* Mid-size HOAs (100-500 units) that want quality + coverage

**A3. UpTend + Standalone Pros**
- HOA contracts with UpTend
- Individual verified pros on our platform handle jobs
- No partner company middleman
- UpTend is the full workforce layer

*Pros:*
- Lowest cost (no company markup on top of pro rates)
- Most flexible (scale up/down instantly)
- Every pro is individually vetted, insured, tracked
- HOA gets the full UpTend tech stack

*Cons:*
- More coordination needed
- Individual pros may have capacity limits
- HOA might want the comfort of a "company" behind the work

*Best for:* HOAs that are cost-conscious and trust the platform model

**Scheduling under Model A:**
- **Recurring:** Weekly landscaping, bi-weekly pool, monthly common area cleaning, quarterly gutter cleaning, annual pressure washing
- **On-demand:** Handyman calls, emergency repairs, unit turnover cleanouts, event prep
- **Seasonal:** Hurricane prep, spring pressure washing, fall gutter cleaning
- UpTend dashboard manages ALL of this with automated scheduling, pro dispatch, and compliance reporting

---

### Model B: "Homeowner Pays" (Preferred/Exclusive Vendor)

**How it works:** UpTend becomes the HOA's recommended or exclusive vendor. Individual homeowners book and pay for their own services. The HOA endorses UpTend and may get a dashboard to oversee community-wide service activity.

**B1. Preferred Vendor (Recommended)**
- HOA recommends UpTend to all homeowners
- Homeowners get a community discount (e.g., 10% off)
- HOA gets a read-only dashboard: see what maintenance is happening across the community
- No cost to the HOA

*Pros:*
- Zero risk/cost for the HOA
- Homeowners get better pricing through group buying power
- HOA can track community maintenance levels
- Easy sell: "We found you a better option, here it is"

*Cons:*
- Lower adoption (voluntary)
- HOA has less control over service quality
- Revenue per unit is lower (individual transactions vs. master contract)

*Best for:* HOAs that don't want financial commitment but want to offer value to residents

**B2. Exclusive Vendor (Mandatory/Sole Provider)**
- HOA mandates UpTend as the ONLY approved vendor for certain services
- Homeowners must book through UpTend for HOA-regulated work (exterior maintenance, landscaping, etc.)
- HOA gets full dashboard + compliance tools
- UpTend pays the HOA a referral fee or revenue share

*Pros:*
- Guaranteed volume
- Consistent quality across the community
- HOA earns passive income from the partnership
- Full compliance documentation (every job photographed, timestamped)
- Property values protected (uniform maintenance standards)

*Cons:*
- Homeowners may push back on losing vendor choice
- HOA board needs to vote on exclusivity
- Legal review needed for CC&R amendments

*Best for:* HOAs with strong boards that want uniform standards and passive income

## Revenue Model for Each Approach

| Model | HOA Pays | Pro Fee | Customer Fee | UpTend Rev/Unit/Year |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| A1 (One Partner) | Master contract | 15% of contract | $0 | ~$200-400 |

| A3 (Standalone Pros) | Master contract | 15% per job | $0 | ~$250-450 |
| B1 (Preferred) | $0 | 15% per job | 5% per job | ~$50-150 |
| B2 (Exclusive) | Dashboard fee ($3-8/unit/mo) | 15% per job | 5% per job | ~$150-300 |

**For a 377-unit community like Ellison at Nona (Faver Gray):**

| Model | Annual UpTend Revenue |
|-------|----------------------|
| A2 (Multi-Vendor Master) | $113K - $189K |
| A3 (Standalone Pros) | $94K - $170K |

| B1 (Preferred) | $19K - $57K |

## The Pitch for This Afternoon

### Opening
"Right now you're managing 15 different vendors with phone calls, spreadsheets, and hope. What if you had ONE platform that handled scheduling, dispatch, insurance verification, documentation, and compliance reporting for every service your community needs?"

### The Hook
"We're not asking you to change what services you need. We're giving you a better way to manage all of them. And we can do it cheaper than what you're paying now."

### The Close (depending on which model fits)

**If they want full service (Model A):**
"Let's start with your top 3 pain points. We'll handle those first, prove the value, then expand to the full scope. Zero risk: if we don't outperform your current vendors in 90 days, walk away."

**If they want to test the waters (Model B1):**
"We'll set up your community portal for free. Send a welcome email to all residents with their community discount code. You'll see the dashboard light up within the first week."

**If they want exclusivity (Model B2):**
"We'll draft the vendor agreement, handle the board presentation materials, and give you 90 days of data to present at the next annual meeting. We make you look good."

## Things We Haven't Covered Yet — Expansion Ideas

### 1. HOA Reserve Fund Integration
- Connect our maintenance data to reserve study projections
- "You spent $45K on pressure washing this year. Based on building age, expect 12% increase next year."
- Helps HOAs budget accurately and avoid special assessments

### 2. Community Marketplace
- Homeowners within the HOA can book shared services at group rates
- "Your neighbor is getting their gutters cleaned Tuesday. Add yours for 30% off."
- Batching = cheaper for homeowners, more efficient for pros

### 3. Violation-to-Service Pipeline
- HOA issues a maintenance violation (dead lawn, dirty exterior)
- Homeowner gets a notification with a one-tap booking link
- Violation auto-clears when the job is completed + documented
- Saves the HOA from being the bad guy

### 4. Insurance Partnership Revenue
- Every pro needs insurance. We partner with Thimble/Next Insurance.
- HOA can require minimum coverage levels through our platform
- We earn 10-15% commission on insurance policies
- HOA gets verified insurance docs without chasing vendors

### 5. Seasonal Package Deals
- "Spring Package" (pressure washing + landscaping + gutter cleaning): bundled pricing
- Pre-sold to the entire community at a group rate
- HOA approves once, entire community benefits

### 6. Emergency Response Protocol
- Hurricane prep: board up windows, secure outdoor furniture, generator testing
- Flood response: water extraction, mold prevention
- UpTend becomes the HOA's emergency services coordinator
- 24/7 dispatch through George

### 7. New Construction / Developer Partnerships
- Builder hands off to HOA → UpTend is already in place
- Warranty period maintenance tracking
- Transition from builder warranty to homeowner maintenance seamlessly

### 8. Property Value Protection
- Communities using UpTend can show verified maintenance records
- "This community has a 94% maintenance compliance rate"
- Real estate agents can reference community-wide Home DNA data
- Attracts buyers, protects values

### 9. Board Meeting Automation
- George generates monthly/quarterly board reports automatically
- Spending summaries, vendor performance, upcoming schedules
- "Here's your Q1 maintenance report" — auto-emailed to board members

### 10. Multi-Community Management
- Property management companies managing multiple HOAs
- One login, multiple community dashboards
- Portfolio-level analytics and vendor management
- Volume pricing across communities
