# UpTend Marketing & Customer Acquisition Strategy

**Lake Nona → Orlando Metro Launch**
*Last updated: February 18, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

UpTend is launching a home services marketplace in Lake Nona, FL — one of the most affluent, tech-forward planned communities in America. Our AI assistant "George" is the primary UX: customers talk to George, George handles everything. The Home DNA Scan is our free viral hook — scan your home, get $25 in credits, and George tells you what your home needs.

**The goal:** 100 paying customers and 20 active pros in 90 days.

**The thesis:** Lake Nona is a petri dish. 30,000+ residents, median household income $120K+, 70% homeownership, and a community obsessed with technology (it's literally called "Medical City" and is a smart city testbed). If we can't win here, we can't win anywhere. But we will win here, because nobody is giving Lake Nona residents a single AI-powered concierge for their entire home.

4. **Remote workers / WFH professionals** — Lake Nona has a massive WFH population post-COVID. Home is their office, so home quality matters more. *Find them at: Lake Nona coworking spaces, LinkedIn local groups.*

### Secondary: B2B (Months 3–6)

---

## 2. Acquisition Channels (Ranked by Expected ROI)

### Tier 1: Highest ROI — Do These First

#### 1. HOA Partnerships (CAC: $5–$15/customer)
**Why #1:** One conversation with an HOA board = 50–500 potential customers. Lake Nona has 15+ active HOAs.

**Tactics:**
- Identify the top 5 HOAs by size: Laureate Park (~3,500 homes), Village Walk, Northlake Park, Storey Park, Moss Park
- Attend board meetings (most are monthly, open to residents and vendors)
- Offer: "Free Home DNA Scan for all residents" + $25 credit per household
- Propose: UpTend as preferred vendor for common area maintenance (pressure washing, landscaping, pool)
- Create HOA-specific landing page: `uptendapp.com/lakenona/[hoa-name]`
- Offer HOA board members 3 free services as trial

**Expected yield:** 2 HOA partnerships → 40–80 customers in first 90 days

#### 2. Nextdoor (CAC: $0–$10/customer)
**Why:** Lake Nona Nextdoor is extremely active. Homeowners literally ask "who's a good pressure washer?" weekly.

**Tactics:**
- Create UpTend business page on Nextdoor
- Monitor and respond to every home service request in Lake Nona neighborhoods
- Post 2x/week: before/after photos, George demo clips, customer testimonials
- Run Nextdoor Local Deals: "Free Home DNA Scan — see what your home needs" ($50–$100/mo)
- Engage authentically in community threads (not salesy)

**Expected yield:** 15–25 customers in first 90 days

#### 3. Referral Program (CAC: $25/customer)
**Why:** $25 credit per referral is cheap for a customer worth $200–$500/year. And Lake Nona is a tight community — word of mouth is currency.

**Tactics:**
- Both referrer and referee get $25 credit
- George prompts referral after every completed service: *"Hey [name], glad that went well! Know anyone else in Lake Nona who'd love this? Share your link and you both get $25."*
- Physical referral cards for pros to hand out
- Referral leaderboard: top referrer each month gets a free service
- Track virality coefficient (target: 0.3 — every 10 customers bring 3 more)

**Expected yield:** 15–25 customers from referrals of early adopters

#### 4. Craigslist/Indeed Pro Recruitment → Customer Pipeline (CAC: $0)
**Why:** Every pro you recruit brings their existing customer base. A pressure washer with 30 clients = 30 warm leads.

**Tactics:**
- Post on Craigslist Orlando, Indeed, Facebook Marketplace for each vertical
- During onboarding, ask: "Want to bring your existing clients onto the platform? They get $25 credit, you get priority booking."
- Pros become evangelists because UpTend handles their marketing, scheduling, and payments
- Pro-to-customer conversion target: each pro brings 5–10 customers

**Expected yield:** 20 pros × 5 customers each = potentially 100 customers (but conservatively 20–40)

### Tier 2: Strong ROI — Start Week 2–3

#### 5. Facebook/Instagram Geo-Targeted Ads (CAC: $20–$40/customer)
**Why:** Precise Lake Nona geo-targeting, visual before/after content performs well.

**Tactics:**
- Target: 32827 zip code + 5-mile radius, homeowners, HHI $100K+, age 28–60
- Ad types:
  - **Hook ad:** "Lake Nona homeowners: scan your home with AI, get $25 free" (drive to Home DNA Scan)
  - **Before/after carousel:** pressure washing, junk removal transformations
  - **George demo video:** 30-sec screen recording of booking through George
  - **Social proof:** customer testimonial clips
- Budget: $30–$50/day initially
- Retarget website visitors and Home DNA Scan users who didn't convert
- A/B test: Home DNA Scan CTA vs direct booking CTA

**Expected yield:** 15–30 customers in first 90 days at $25–$35 CAC

#### 6. Google Ads — Local Service Ads (CAC: $30–$50/customer)
**Why:** Highest intent — someone Googling "pressure washing Lake Nona" is ready to buy.

**Tactics:**
- Google Local Service Ads (pay per lead, ~$15–$40/lead depending on vertical)
- Priority verticals by search volume and margin:
  1. Pressure washing (highest search volume in FL)
  2. Home cleaning
  3. Junk removal
  4. Pool cleaning
  5. Landscaping
- Google Ads search campaigns for "[service] Lake Nona" and "[service] Orlando"
- Landing pages per service per neighborhood (SEO + paid)
- Budget: $500–$1,000/mo initially, scale what converts

**Expected yield:** 10–20 customers in first 90 days

#### 7. Local Events & Sponsorships (CAC: $15–$25/customer)
**Why:** Lake Nona has constant community events. Physical presence builds trust in a new brand.

**Tactics:**
- **Lake Nona Farmers Market** (Saturdays) — booth with live George demos, free Home DNA Scans on iPads ($200/weekend for booth)
- **Boxi Park events** — sponsor a trivia night or live music event ($500–$1,000)
- **Lake Nona Impact Forum** — if timing aligns, get a demo slot
- **Kids' sports leagues** — sponsor a team ($250–$500), banner + flyers to parents
- **School fundraisers** — "Book through UpTend, 10% goes to [school]"
- Bring branded swag: t-shirts, fridge magnets with QR code to George
- Always collect emails/phones for follow-up

**Expected yield:** 10–15 customers in first 90 days

### Tier 3: Medium ROI — Start Month 2

#### 8. SEO / Content (CAC: $5–$15/customer at scale, slow to start)
**Why:** Compounds over time. "Pressure washing Lake Nona" pages will rank within 2–3 months for local terms.

**Tactics:**
- Landing pages for every `[service] + [neighborhood]` combination:
  - `uptendapp.com/pressure-washing-lake-nona`
  - `uptendapp.com/junk-removal-orlando`
  - `uptendapp.com/pool-cleaning-laureate-park`
- Blog content: "How much does pressure washing cost in Orlando?" "Lake Nona home maintenance checklist"
- Google Business Profile optimization (reviews are critical — ask every customer)
- Local citations: Yelp, BBB, Angi (free listings), HomeAdvisor
- Target: 30+ location pages in first 60 days

**Expected yield in 90 days:** 5–10 customers (but accelerates to 30+/mo by month 6)

#### 9. TikTok/Instagram Reels (CAC: $0–$10 organic, $15–$30 paid)
**Why:** Before/after home service content is viral gold. George demos are novel enough to get attention.

**Tactics:**
- Content types:
  - **Before/after transformations** (pressure washing is TikTok gold — 10M+ views on top posts)
  - **"George, book me a..." demos** showing the AI in action
  - **Day-in-the-life of an UpTend pro**
  - **Home maintenance tips** (George explains seasonal maintenance)
  - **Satisfying cleaning videos** (ASMR pressure washing, carpet cleaning)
- Post 3–5x/week on TikTok and Instagram Reels
- Use local hashtags: #LakeNona #OrlandoHome #LakeNonaLiving
- Boost top-performing organic posts ($10–$20/day)

**Expected yield in 90 days:** 5–15 customers (but builds brand for long-term)

#### 10. Strategic Partnerships (CAC: $10–$20/customer)
**Why:** Leverage existing trust relationships.

**Tactics:**
- **Real estate agents:** Offer move-in packages. Top 10 Lake Nona realtors get white-glove treatment.
- **Interior designers/stagers:** Referral partnership for cleaning, handyman
- **Smart home installers:** Cross-promote — "Got your Ring doorbell? Now get George to manage everything else."
- **Local businesses:** Reciprocal promotion with Lake Nona restaurants, gyms, etc.

**Expected yield:** 5–10 customers in first 90 days

## 6. George as Growth Engine

George isn't just the product — George is the growth loop.

### 6.1 Home DNA Scan Virality

The Home DNA Scan is our Trojan horse. It's free, it's novel, and it creates demand.

**Flow:**
1. Customer uploads photos of their home (exterior + interior)
2. George analyzes and generates a "Home Health Report" — identifies maintenance needs, estimates costs, prioritizes by urgency
3. Customer gets $25 credit to act on the first recommendation
4. George follows up: *"Your gutters looked like they haven't been cleaned in 8+ months. Want me to schedule a cleaning this week? You have $25 in credit."*

**Viral mechanics:**
- **Shareability:** "Home Health Score" is shareable (like a credit score for your house). *"My home scored 72/100 — what's yours?"*
- **Neighborhood comparison:** *"Homes in Laureate Park average 78/100. Yours is 65. Here's why."*
- **Social proof prompt:** After scan, George says: *"Want to share your Home Health Score? Send this link to neighbors — they get a free scan and $25, you get $25."*
- **Seasonal triggers:** George emails/texts: *"Hurricane season is coming. Your home scan showed your gutters need attention. Want to get ahead of it?"*

**Target:** 500 Home DNA Scans in 90 days → 100 convert to paying customers (20% conversion)

### 6.2 Referral Prompts (Built into George)

George doesn't just wait for referrals — George creates referral moments:

- **Post-service high:** Right after a 5-star service: *"Glad you loved it! Share the love — here's your referral link. $25 for you, $25 for them."*
- **Neighborhood notification:** *"3 of your neighbors just booked pressure washing this week. Want me to add you to the schedule?"*
- **Seasonal batch:** *"I'm putting together a Lake Nona pool cleaning route for next week. 15% off if I can add your home. Want in?"*

### 6.3 George as Retention Engine

- **Proactive maintenance reminders:** George tracks service history and nudges: *"It's been 6 months since your last gutter cleaning. Lake Nona averages every 4 months. Want me to schedule?"*
- **Multi-service expansion:** After first service, George suggests related: *"Since we just cleaned your gutters, want me to check your pressure washing? I noticed some buildup in your home scan."*
- **Seasonal campaigns:** George runs "Spring cleaning", "Hurricane prep", "Holiday hosting" campaigns automatically
- **Price lock:** *"Your pressure washer quoted $200 last time. I can lock that rate for quarterly service. Want me to set it up?"*

### 6.4 Neighborhood Network Effects

- **Route optimization messaging:** *"A pressure washing crew is in Laureate Park on Thursday. I can add your house for 20% less since they're already in the area."*
- **Social proof in real-time:** *"12 homes on your street have used UpTend this month."*
- **Block deals:** *"Get 4+ neighbors to book the same service and everyone saves 15%."*

## 10. Competitive Positioning

### The Landscape

| Competitor | Model | Weakness UpTend Exploits |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------|
| **Thumbtack** | Lead marketplace — pros bid on jobs, pay per lead | Pros hate paying for leads that don't convert. Customers get spammed by 5 pros. No relationship. |
| **Angi (HomeAdvisor)** | Lead gen + subscriptions | Expensive for pros ($300–$500/mo), low lead quality, no AI, terrible UX |
| **TaskRabbit** | Gig marketplace | Limited to small tasks, no recurring, no home intelligence, low pro quality for big jobs |
| **Yelp** | Reviews + ads | Just discovery, no booking, no management, no AI |
| **Handy** | Standardized cleaning/handyman | Limited verticals, no personalization, commoditized |
| **Local contractors** | Direct relationship | No technology, hard to find, inconsistent availability |

### Why UpTend Wins

**1. George — The AI Home Manager**
Nobody else has this. Thumbtack makes you search, compare, and message 5 pros. George handles everything in one conversation. This is the iPhone vs. flip phone moment for home services.

**2. Home DNA Scan — Free Value First**
Competitors charge from the first interaction. UpTend gives you a free home assessment and credits before you spend a dollar. This inverts the funnel.

**3. One Platform, Every Service**
Thumbtack and TaskRabbit are one-off transactional. UpTend becomes your ongoing home operating system. Book cleaning this week, landscaping next month, handyman for that thing you've been putting off — all through George.

**4. Pro-Friendly Economics**
- Thumbtack: $15–$50 per lead (whether it converts or not)
- Angi: $300+/mo subscription + lead fees
- UpTend: 0% until you earn. 20–25% on completed jobs. Pros only pay when they get paid.

**5. Neighborhood Network Effects**
Thumbtack is national and generic. UpTend starts hyperlocal. When 20% of your street uses UpTend, it becomes the default. Route optimization means better prices when your neighbors book too.

**6. Proactive, Not Reactive**
Every competitor waits for you to have a problem. George tells you about problems before they're expensive: *"Your home scan showed moss on your roof. Want to address it before it causes damage?"*

### Positioning Statement

> **For Lake Nona homeowners who are tired of juggling contractors, UpTend is the AI-powered home management platform that handles everything through one conversation with George. Unlike Thumbtack or Angi, which make you do all the work, George knows your home, anticipates your needs, and handles the details — from booking to payment to follow-up.**

### Tagline Options

- *"George handles it."*
- *"Your home's AI assistant."*
- *"One conversation. Every home service."*
- *"The smartest way to manage your home."*
