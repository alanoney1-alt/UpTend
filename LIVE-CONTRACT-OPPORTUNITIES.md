## INVESTOR PITCH DATA

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Active FL opportunities in our verticals | **1,715+** |
| Estimated total annual FL gov contract value (our NAICS) | **$200M-$500M** |
| SDVOSB sole-source threshold | **$5M per contract** |

**The story:** UpTend isn't just a consumer marketplace. With dual minority + veteran certification, we have access to $200M+ in annual Florida government contracts where the federal government is LEGALLY REQUIRED to award a percentage to businesses like ours. This is guaranteed, recession-proof revenue that de-risks the entire business model.
