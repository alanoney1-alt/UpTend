# PART 1: DWELLSCAN PRO CERTIFICATION

## 1. DwellScan Overview & Requirements

### What is DwellScan?

DwellScan is UpTend's signature property documentation service — the **"Carfax for Homes."** It creates a comprehensive baseline record of a property's condition, capturing every system, surface, and appliance through photos, 360° video, and AI analysis. This data powers the **Property Health Score (1-100)**, feeds insurance partnerships, supports warranty claims, and becomes a transferable asset at resale.

**Why this matters:** You're not just taking photos. You're building a permanent record that helps homeowners:
- Track their property's health over time
- File insurance claims faster with pre-loss documentation
- Prove maintenance for warranty claims
- Qualify for insurance premium discounts
- Transfer a complete property report to buyers at resale

**Your role:** You are the data collector. The better your documentation, the more valuable the homeowner's property intelligence becomes.

## 7. AI Integration & Appliance Scanning

### How AI Powers DwellScan

Every photo and video you upload is processed by UpTend's AI system:

1. **Auto-Categorization** — AI detects "this is a kitchen photo," "this is a roof photo," etc.
2. **Condition Scoring** — AI rates condition (1-10 scale) for each area
3. **Damage Detection** — AI flags cracks, stains, mold, rust, wear
4. **Appliance Recognition** — AI reads model plates, extracts brand/model/serial
5. **Property Health Score** — AI calculates 1-100 score across 8 categories
6. **Smart Recommendations** — AI suggests maintenance, services, repairs

**Your Job:** Provide high-quality inputs (photos/videos). AI does the analysis.

---

### Appliance Scanning Protocol

**3 Ways to Add Appliances:**

**Method 1: AI Model Plate Scan (Preferred)**
1. Clean model plate with microfiber cloth
2. Open UpTend app → Tap **'Scan Appliance'**
3. Point camera at model plate
4. Hold steady until green checkmark appears
5. AI extracts: Brand, Model, Serial, Category, Warranty Info, Install Date (estimated from serial)
6. Review extracted data → **Confirm** or **Edit**
7. Tap **Save to Property**

**Method 2: Manual Entry**
1. If AI can't read plate, tap **'Enter Manually'**
2. Input: Brand, Model, Serial, Category, Location
3. Tap **Save**

**Method 3: Photo for Later Processing**
1. Take clear photo of model plate
2. Tap **'Save for Later Processing'**
3. UpTend's backend AI will process overnight
4. Homeowner reviews next day

---

### AI Confidence Scoring

After each scan, AI shows confidence:

- **90-100% confidence** = Auto-confirms, immediately added to registry
- **70-89% confidence** = Flags for homeowner review (usually correct but needs confirmation)
- **<70% confidence** = Needs manual verification

**Your Role:** If confidence is low, try rescanning with better lighting/cleaning. If still fails, use manual entry.

---

### Warranty Auto-Lookup

After scanning appliance, AI automatically:
1. **Looks up manufacturer warranty terms** (standard 1-year parts/labor, extended coverage if registered)
2. **Calculates warranty expiration date** (from install date or purchase date if known)
3. **Checks CPSC recall database** (alerts homeowner if appliance is recalled)

### Pro Scanning Bonus

**You earn $1 per confirmed appliance** scanned during ANY UpTend job (not just DwellScan).

**How it works:**
- You're doing a FreshWash → You scan the exterior HVAC unit while you're there
- Doing a PoolSpark → You scan the pool pump/heater model plates
- Doing a PolishUp → You scan all kitchen appliances while cleaning

**Rules:**
- Must be a new appliance (not already in customer's registry)
- Must pass AI confirmation (70%+ confidence) OR homeowner manually confirms
- $1 bonus added to your payout for that job
- Tracked in your Pro dashboard: "Appliances Scanned This Month: 47 | Bonus Earned: $47"

**Why this matters:**
- Every appliance scanned makes the homeowner's Property Health Score more accurate
- More complete registries = better insurance partnerships = more value for customers
- More data = smarter AI recommendations = more UpTend bookings
- **You're building the most comprehensive property database in the country**

**Your Follow-Up (Optional but Encouraged):**

Send a personal text 24 hours later:

> "Hi [Name], just wanted to follow up on your DwellScan. You should have your Property Health Score by now. Let me know if you have any questions about the report!"

**Why this matters:** Personal touch = higher ratings + more referrals.

---

### Handling Customer Concerns Post-Service

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: "My Property Health Score is lower than I expected"**

**Your Response:**
> "The score is based on the age and condition of your home's systems compared to industry standards. The good news is the report shows exactly what you can do to improve it. Most homeowners raise their score 10-15 points within the first year just by addressing the priority items. Want me to help you understand the recommendations?"

**Scenario 2: "I don't see [appliance] in my registry"**

**Your Response:**
> "Let me check — sometimes appliances with worn model plates take longer for AI to process. If it didn't scan clearly, I can manually add it for you. What's the brand and model?"

**Scenario 3: "The photos show [item] that needs repair. Can you fix it?"**

**Your Response:**
> "Great question. DwellScan is documentation only — I'm not making repairs during the service. But I can definitely send you a quote for [service] to address that. Or you can book directly through your UpTend dashboard. Want me to put together a quote?"

## 10. Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Equipment Issues

**Problem: Phone battery dying during service**
- **Solution:** Always bring portable charger. Dim screen, close background apps, turn off Bluetooth/AirDrop.
- **Prevention:** Start with 80%+ charge, use battery saver mode.

**Problem: App crashing or freezing**
- **Solution:** Force close app, reopen. If persists, restart phone.
- **Prevention:** Keep app updated, clear cache weekly.

**Problem: AI won't scan appliance model plate**
- **Solution:** Clean plate, improve lighting, try multiple angles. If still fails, use manual entry.
- **Common causes:** Worn labels, reflective surfaces, poor lighting.

**Problem: Drone won't take off (Aerial)**
- **Solution:** Check GPS signal, battery level, firmware updates, obstacles.
- **Safety:** Never force takeoff. If unsafe, abort and reschedule.

---

### Customer Situations

**Problem: Customer follows you around entire time**
- **Solution:** This is normal and fine. Some homeowners want to be involved. Answer questions, stay professional.
- **Communication:** "Feel free to follow along. I'll explain what I'm documenting as I go."

**Problem: Customer blocks access to certain rooms**
- **Solution:** Respect their wishes. Note in app: "Master bedroom not accessible per homeowner request."
- **Impact on score:** Property Health Score will note incomplete data.

**Problem: Pets not secured**
- **Solution:** Ask politely for pets to be secured. If customer refuses, document safely around pets.
- **Safety:** Do NOT enter rooms with aggressive animals. Note in app and reschedule if necessary.

**Problem: Property is significantly different than listed**
- **Solution:** Update property details in app immediately (sqft, bed/bath count, special features).
- **Pricing:** If scope dramatically larger, contact UpTend support via app for price adjustment before continuing.

---

### Weather Issues (Aerial)

**Problem: Wind picks up mid-flight**
- **Solution:** Return drone to home immediately if wind exceeds 15 mph.
- **Safety:** ALWAYS prioritize safe landing over getting the shot.

**Problem: Sudden rain during exterior walkthrough**
- **Solution:** Move to interior documentation. Resume exterior after rain passes if safe.

**Rescheduling:** If weather makes service unsafe/impossible:
1. Contact customer immediately
2. Reschedule via app (no reschedule fee for weather)
3. Note reason: "Weather unsafe for aerial inspection"

---

### Technical AI Issues

**Problem: AI miscategorizes photos**
- **Solution:** You can override in app: Tap photo → "Change Category" → Select correct area.

**Problem: AI gives wrong appliance info**
- **Solution:** Edit in app: Tap appliance → "Edit Details" → Correct info → Save.

**Problem: AI confidence low on all scans**
- **Solution:** Check lighting, cleanliness, focus. If still failing, possible app bug — report to support.

---

### Safety Issues

**If you encounter any of these, STOP immediately:**

🚨 **Active gas leak** — Evacuate, call 911, notify homeowner
🚨 **Live electrical hazard** — Do not touch, note in app, inform homeowner
🚨 **Structural collapse risk** — Do not enter area, professional engineer needed
🚨 **Aggressive animals** — Leave immediately, reschedule with pets secured
🚨 **Hazardous materials** (asbestos, mold, chemicals) — Do not disturb, note and move on

**Your safety and the homeowner's safety are ALWAYS the top priority.**

### Quality Standards

**UpTend BulkSnap Quality Checklist:**

✅ **Site left cleaner than found** (sweep, remove debris)
✅ **All requested items removed** (customer walk-through confirmed)
✅ **60%+ diversion rate** (recycle + donate ÷ total weight)
✅ **All disposal receipts uploaded** (with GPS stamps)
✅ **Before/After photos** (clear transformation)
✅ **Customer signature** obtained in app
✅ **No damage** to property, landscaping, or adjacent structures

**Red Flags (Will Tank Your Rating):**
- ❌ Items left behind

- ❌ No disposal receipts (looks like illegal dumping)
- ❌ Low diversion rate (<40%)
- ❌ Complaints about unprofessional behavior

---

### Common Issues

**Issue: Customer wants to keep items after loading started**
- **Solution:** Unload items they want to keep. Do NOT charge extra (policy = flexible). Better rating > small upcharge.

**Issue: More junk than quoted (significantly more)**
- **Solution:** Stop loading, contact customer: "This is about 30% more than quoted. I can finish for $X additional. OK?" Get approval before continuing.

**Issue: Donation center closed/won't accept items**
- **Solution:** Try alternate donation partner (app lists backups). If all refuse, mark as "Donation Attempted - Refused" and dispose responsibly.

**Issue: Customer claims damaged item during removal**
- **Solution:** Review "Before" photos. If damage visible, not your fault. If new damage, report immediately via app for insurance claim.

   - **House siding/stucco:** Apply house wash detergent, let dwell 10 min
   - **Mold/mildew:** Apply mold remover, let dwell 10-15 min
2. Avoid letting chemicals dry on surface (re-wet if needed)
3. Do NOT let chemicals contact plants (rinse immediately if overspray occurs)

**Step 4: Pressure Washing (30-60 min)**

**Driveway/Concrete:**
1. Use surface cleaner attachment (even, fast coverage)
2. Overlap passes by 6 inches (no streaks)
3. Work in sections (don't let one area dry while washing another)
4. Use wand for edges, corners, tight spots
5. Focus extra passes on oil stains, rust stains
6. Angle spray toward drainage (not toward house)

**Walkways/Patios:**
1. Same as driveway technique
2. Lower pressure for pavers, brick (prevent erosion of joint sand)
3. Rinse thoroughly (no chemical residue = slippery)

**House Siding/Stucco:**
1. **Start from bottom, work up** (prevents streaks)
2. Use 25° or 40° nozzle (wide spray, low impact)
3. Keep nozzle 12-18 inches from surface
4. Overlap passes
5. Rinse from **top down** (gravity helps)
6. Check for loose siding, caulking — stop if damage visible

**Pool Deck:**
1. Clear all furniture, pool equipment
2. Use 25° nozzle (40° for textured surfaces)
3. Avoid spraying directly into pool (chemicals contaminate water)
4. Rinse toward drains, not into pool

**Garage Door:**
1. Use 25° or 40° nozzle
2. Low pressure (1500-2000 PSI max)
3. Rinse top to bottom
4. Avoid spraying weatherstripping, seals

**Step 5: Post-Rinse & Inspection (10 min)**

   - Cleanliness improvement score (AI): Before 3.2/10 → After 9.1/10
   - Carbon offset: CO2e from avoided water treatment

---

### Quality Standards

✅ **No streaks, missed spots**
✅ **No damage** to surfaces, plants, fixtures
✅ **All chemical residue rinsed** (touch test: not slippery)
✅ **Dramatic transformation** (before/after AI score improvement 4+ points)
✅ **Water reclamation used** (if system available)
✅ **Customer signature** obtained

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Streaks, uneven cleaning
- ❌ Damaged siding, paint, plants
- ❌ Chemical residue left behind
- ❌ Water waste (no attempt at conservation)

---

### Common Issues

**Issue: Oil stains won't come out**
- **Solution:** Apply degreaser, let dwell 15+ min, use 0° nozzle (carefully), hot water if available. Some old stains permanent — set expectation with customer.

**Issue: Siding looks worse after washing (streaks, discoloration)**
- **Solution:** Oxidation revealed. This is pre-existing (old siding degrading). Explain to customer: "Washing revealed existing wear. The siding may need repainting." NOT your fault.

**Issue: Customer wants roof cleaned**
- **Solution:** Roof cleaning is NOT part of FreshWash. Requires special low-pressure method + roof access. Refer customer to DwellScan Aerial tier or specialized roof cleaning service.

**Issue: Pool water splashed during wash**
- **Solution:** Minor splashes OK (pool chemicals balance it). Major contamination = offer to add extra chlorine or call pool service. Document in app.

---

### Pro Tips for Maximum Earnings

💰 **Bundle Discount:** Customer books FreshWash + GutterFlush same day = you earn more (15% bonus).
💰 **Seasonal Demand:** Pre-summer (April-May) is peak season in Florida = surge pricing.

- ✅ **1:4 ratio** — Ladder base 1ft away from wall for every 4ft of height
- ✅ **Never lean** — Keep belt buckle between ladder rails
- ✅ **Stabilizer required** — NEVER rest ladder directly on gutters (causes dents, sagging)
- ✅ **Level ground** — Use levelers on slopes
- 🚨 **DO NOT use ladder in high wind (15+ mph), rain, or on wet surfaces**

**Roof Access:**
- ⚠️ Only access roof if:
  - Pitch <6:12 (not too steep)
  - Dry conditions
  - Non-tile roof (tile is fragile)
  - Customer explicitly approves
- 🚨 **If uncomfortable, work from ladder only** (your safety > completing job)

---

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Pre-Job Assessment (5 min)**
1. Mark "Arrived" in app
2. Walk perimeter with customer, assess:
   - Gutter height (1-story, 2-story)
   - Gutter type (aluminum, vinyl, copper)
   - Downspout count
   - Gutter condition (sagging, rust, previous repairs visible)
   - Trees overhanging (heavy leaf load expected)
3. Take "BEFORE" photos:

2. **Climb with scoop and bucket**
3. **Scoop debris** from gutters:
   - Work left to right (6-8ft reach per ladder position)
   - Drop debris into bucket or onto tarp below (not on landscaping)
   - Check for: wasp nests, critters, shingle grit, roofing nails
4. **Check gutter hangers** as you go:
   - Loose? Note in app for customer ("Hanger at front left corner needs re-securing")
   - Sagging? Note in app
5. **Reposition ladder** every 6-8 feet (NEVER overreach)
6. **Repeat until all gutters clear**

**Downspout Flushing:**

1. After gutters clear, flush each downspout from top:
   - Remove downspout screen/guard if present
   - Insert garden hose into downspout opening
   - Turn water on full pressure
   - Watch discharge at bottom (should flow freely)
2. If clogged:
   - Use plumber's snake from top or bottom
   - Disassemble elbow joint if needed (take photo of how it's assembled first)
   - Flush again until clear
3. Reassemble downspout components

**Step 4: Post-Clean Inspection & Minor Repairs (10 min)**

Walk perimeter, check for:
- ✅ Gutters draining properly (no standing water)
- ✅ All downspouts flowing
- ⚠️ Issues to flag:
  - Loose hangers (note location)
  - Cracks, holes, rust spots
  - Improper pitch (water pooling)
  - Missing downspout extensions (water discharging too close to foundation)

**Step 5: Debris Disposal (5 min)**
1. Collect all debris from tarp
2. Separate:
   - **Organic** (leaves, twigs, roof moss) → Compostable, bag for yard waste pickup
   - **Inorganic** (shingle grit, nails, trash) → Landfill bag
3. Sweep area around ladder positions
4. Dispose of debris (customer's outdoor bin, or haul away if requested)

**Step 6: After Photos & Customer Walkthrough (5 min)**
1. Take "AFTER" photos (same angles as "BEFORE")
2. Run hose in one section of gutter to demonstrate flow
3. Walk property with customer, point out:
   - Clear gutters
   - Flowing downspouts
   - Any flagged issues (show photos)
4. Recommend: "Your gutters should be cleaned every 6 months (spring & fall). Want to schedule the next one now?"
5. Get customer signature in app

**Step 7: Post-Job Documentation (5 min)**
1. Mark "Job Complete" in app
2. App calculates:
   - Debris weight diverted to compost: X lbs
   - Condition score: Before 3/10 → After 9/10
   - Prevented water damage risk: High → Low
3. Customer receives maintenance reminder in 6 months

---

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Pre-Service Assessment (5 min)**
1. Mark "Arrived" in app
2. Walk pool area, assess:
   - Pool type (in-ground vs. above-ground)
   - Surface type (plaster, pebble, tile)
   - Size (estimate gallons: length × width × avg depth × 7.5)
   - Current condition (clear, cloudy, green, debris visible)
   - Equipment location (pump, filter, heater, salt chlorinator if present)
3. Take "BEFORE" photos:
   - Full pool overview (surface condition)
   - Skimmer baskets (if full of debris)
   - Tile line (if dirty/stained)
   - Equipment (pump, filter)

**Step 2: Skim Surface (5-10 min)**
1. Attach skimmer net to telescopic pole
2. Skim all floating debris:
   - Leaves, bugs, twigs
   - Pollen (common in spring)
   - Use fine mesh net for small particles
3. Dispose of debris (customer's yard waste bin or bag)

**Step 3: Brush Walls & Tile Line (10 min)**
1. Attach pool brush to telescopic pole
2. Brush all walls (top to bottom):
   - Removes algae, dirt, calcium buildup
   - Focus on areas with visible stains
3. Brush tile line vigorously (prevents calcium ring formation)
4. Brush steps, benches, shallow ledge
5. Brush around all return jets, skimmer openings

**Step 4: Vacuum Pool Floor (15-20 min)**

**Manual Vacuum Method:**
1. Attach vacuum head to pole
2. Connect vacuum hose to vacuum head
3. Fill hose with water (submerge in pool, let bubbles escape)
4. Connect filled hose to skimmer suction port
5. Turn pump to "filter" mode
6. Vacuum floor in overlapping rows (like mowing a lawn)
7. Move slowly (fast = stirs up debris instead of vacuuming)

**Automatic Vacuum Method:**
1. Place automatic vacuum in pool
2. Turn on (battery or plug in)
3. Let run while you complete other tasks (30-60 min cycle)
4. Remove when done, rinse off

**Step 5: Empty Baskets (5 min)**
1. Turn off pump
2. Open skimmer lid, remove basket
3. Empty debris, rinse basket
4. Replace basket
5. Open pump strainer basket (usually clear lid)
6. Remove debris, rinse
7. Replace lid securely (check O-ring)
8. Turn pump back on

**Step 6: Test Water Chemistry (5 min)**

Using test strips:
1. Dip strip in pool (elbow-deep, away from returns)
2. Wait 15 seconds
3. Compare to chart
4. Record in UpTend app:
   - **pH:** 7.2-7.8 (ideal: 7.4-7.6)
   - **Free Chlorine:** 1-3 ppm (ideal: 2-3 ppm)
   - **Total Alkalinity:** 80-120 ppm (ideal: 100 ppm)
   - **Hardness:** 200-400 ppm

**Step 7: Add Chemicals (As Needed) (5-10 min)**

**If pH too low (<7.2):**
- Add pH Up (soda ash)
- Amount: Follow product label (typically 1 lb per 10,000 gallons raises pH by 0.2)
- Add to deep end with pump running

**If pH too high (>7.8):**
- Add pH Down (muriatic acid OR dry acid)
- Amount: Follow product label carefully
- Pour slowly into deep end, pool circulation on

**If chlorine too low (<1 ppm):**
- Add liquid chlorine OR chlorine tablets to floater/skimmer
- Amount: 1 gallon liquid chlorine per 10,000 gallons raises FC by ~10 ppm
- If using tablets, place 2-3 tablets in skimmer basket or floating dispenser

**If alkalinity too low (<80 ppm):**
- Add alkalinity increaser (baking soda)
- Amount: 1.5 lbs per 10,000 gallons raises TA by 10 ppm

**IMPORTANT:** If chemistry is severely imbalanced (pH <6.8 or >8.2, chlorine 0, green pool), do NOT attempt to fix alone. Note in app: "Major chemical imbalance detected. Professional pool service recommended." Collect fee for cleaning only, don't over-promise.

**Step 8: Backwash Filter (If Needed) (5-10 min)**

When to backwash:
- Pressure gauge reads 8-10 psi above clean pressure
- Water flow from returns is weak
- Water clarity hasn't improved after cleaning

How to backwash (sand/DE filter):
1. Turn off pump
2. Set multiport valve to "BACKWASH"
3. Turn on pump
4. Run until sight glass shows clear water (2-3 min)
5. Turn off pump
6. Set valve to "RINSE"
7. Turn on pump, run 30 seconds
8. Turn off pump
9. Return valve to "FILTER"
10. Turn on pump

**Cartridge Filter:** Remove cartridges, rinse with hose (do NOT backwash)

**Step 9: Final Inspection & Customer Communication (5 min)**
1. Take "AFTER" photos (same angles as "BEFORE")
2. Walk pool deck, check for:
   - Debris removal (clean deck)
   - Equipment running properly
   - Pool clarity improved
3. Inform customer:
   - "Your pool is clean. Chemistry is balanced. Chlorine and pH are in range."
   - If issues detected: "I noticed your pump is making a grinding noise. You may want to have that checked by a pool equipment specialist."
4. Recommend: "Weekly PoolSpark service keeps your pool swim-ready year-round. Want to set up a recurring schedule?"
5. Get customer signature in app

**Step 10: Post-Job Documentation (5 min)**
1. Mark "Job Complete" in app
2. Log chemistry readings
3. Log chemicals added (type, amount)
4. Flag any equipment issues
5. App generates:
   - Before/After clarity score (AI)
   - Chemistry trend over time (if recurring customer)
   - Next service reminder

---

### Quality Standards

✅ **Pool surface 90%+ clear** (minor settling debris OK, will be filtered out)
✅ **Walls brushed** (no visible algae/stains)
✅ **Baskets emptied**
✅ **Chemistry tested & balanced** (within acceptable ranges)
✅ **Equipment running properly** (pump on, filter set correctly)
✅ **Deck cleaned** (no debris scattered)

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Debris still floating after service
- ❌ Walls/tile line not brushed
- ❌ Chemistry not tested
- ❌ Over-chlorinated (customer can't swim = angry)

---

### Common Issues

**Issue: Pool is green (algae bloom)**
- **Solution:** This is beyond PoolSpark basic service. Contact UpTend to escalate to "Green Pool Recovery" specialist. You can skim surface debris and brush walls, but full recovery requires shock treatment + extensive vacuuming.

**Issue: Customer claims pool "still dirty" after service**
- **Solution:** Check filter system. If filter is dirty/broken, pool won't clear even after cleaning. Explain: "I cleaned the pool, but your filter isn't circulating properly. You may need a filter cleaning or repair."

**Issue: Pump won't turn on**
- **Solution:** Check breaker, timer, GFCI. If still not working, note in app: "Pump not operational. Customer needs electrician or pool equipment repair." Do NOT attempt electrical repair.

**Issue: Water level too low**
- **Solution:** Add water via garden hose (to middle of skimmer opening). Low water = pump can't circulate = pool won't clean properly.

---

### Pro Tips for Maximum Earnings

💰 **Recurring Plans:** Weekly PoolSpark = $89/week × 4 weeks = $356/mo per customer. Sign up 10 customers = $3,560/mo guaranteed income.
💰 **Upsell:** "Your filter cartridges look pretty dirty. I can replace them for $X. Improves water clarity."
💰 **Seasonal Demand:** Summer (May-Aug) is peak season in Florida = high demand, can charge premium.

- ✅ Watch for heat exhaustion symptoms (dizziness, nausea, excessive sweating)

---

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Pre-Service Assessment (5 min)**
1. Mark "Arrived" in app
2. Walk property with customer (if home), assess:
   - Lawn size (front, back, sides)
   - Grass height (overgrown = slower mowing)
   - Obstacles (sprinkler heads, decorations, pet toys)
   - Flower beds (needs edging?)
   - Customer preferences (bag vs. mulch, specific mow patterns)
3. Take "BEFORE" photos (4+ angles):
   - Full front yard
   - Full back yard
   - Side yards
   - Close-ups of overgrown areas

**Step 2: Pre-Mow Prep (5 min)**
1. Clear lawn of:
   - Toys, hoses, sprinklers
   - Large sticks, branches
   - Pet waste (alert customer if excessive)
2. Check mower:
   - Blade sharp? (dull blades tear grass = brown tips)
   - Oil level OK?
   - Gas full?
3. Set mowing height:
   - **St. Augustine grass (common in FL):** 3.5-4 inches
   - **Bahia grass:** 3-4 inches
   - **Bermuda grass:** 1.5-2.5 inches
   - **Zoysia grass:** 1-2.5 inches

**Step 3: Mowing (15-30 min)**

**Mowing Pattern:**
1. Start with **perimeter pass** (2-3 laps around entire lawn)
   - Creates turning space
   - Defines edges
2. **Mow interior** in straight lines:
   - Overlap wheel tracks by 3-4 inches (no missed strips)
   - Alternate direction each visit (prevents grass grain, soil compaction)
   - Avoid tight circles (tears grass)

**Mowing Tips:**
- **Grass height rule:** Never cut more than 1/3 of grass height in one mow
  - If grass is 6" tall, cut to 4" (not 2")
  - If severely overgrown, mow twice (first pass high, second pass normal)
- **Wet grass:** If grass is wet, mow slower (clumping), raise deck height
- **Shade areas:** Raise deck 0.5" in shaded areas (grass needs more blade surface for photosynthesis)

**Step 4: Edging (5-10 min)**

**Hard Surface Edging:**
1. Edge all **walkways, driveways, patios**
   - Blade at 90° angle to surface
   - Create clean, defined line (grass vs. concrete)
2. Edge **curb lines** (street-facing)

**Flower Bed Edging:**
1. Edge border between **lawn and flower beds**
   - Prevents grass from invading mulch
   - Creates clean visual separation

**Edging Depth:** 1-2 inches (removes grass runners, prevents overgrowth)

**Step 5: String Trimming (10-15 min)**

Trim areas mower can't reach:
1. **Around trees, poles, fences**
2. **Tight corners, edges**
3. **Under bushes, shrubs** (careful not to scalp bark)
4. **Around mailbox, light posts**

**Trimming Angle:** Hold trimmer parallel to ground (not angled = scalping)

**Step 6: Weeding (5-10 min) (If Customer Requested)**

Pull visible weeds from:
- **Flower beds**
- **Cracks in walkways, driveways**
- **Around mailbox, fences**

**Note:** Do NOT apply chemical weed killer unless you have FL pesticide license.

**Step 7: Blowing (5-10 min)**

Blow all debris off:
1. **Driveways, walkways, patios**
2. **Porches, steps**
3. **Pool deck** (if present)
4. **Driveway approach** (street curb)

**Blow direction:** Toward lawn/flower beds (not into street storm drains, neighbor's yard)

**Step 8: Bagging/Mulching**

**If mulching (default):**
- Clippings decompose, fertilize lawn naturally
- No cleanup needed

**If bagging (customer request or HOA requirement):**
1. Empty mower bag into lawn bags
2. Bag all clippings from hard surfaces
3. Place bags at curb (or dispose per customer instructions)

**Step 9: Final Inspection & Customer Communication (5 min)**
1. Take "AFTER" photos (same angles as "BEFORE")
2. Walk property, check for:
   - Missed patches
   - Debris on hard surfaces
   - Damage from equipment (accidental contact with sprinklers, decorations)
3. If customer is home:
   - "All done! Your lawn looks great. I mowed, edged, trimmed, and blew everything clean. Do you have any questions?"
   - Recommend recurring service: "Most customers love weekly or bi-weekly FreshCut to keep it looking this good. Want to set up a schedule?"
4. Get customer signature in app

**Step 10: Post-Job Documentation (5 min)**
1. Mark "Job Complete" in app
2. App calculates:
   - Grass health score (AI analysis of photos)
   - Carbon sequestered (grass absorbs CO2)
   - Equipment emissions tracked (gas mower vs. electric)
   - Before/After comparison (curb appeal improvement)

---

### Quality Standards

✅ **Grass evenly cut** (no missed strips, scalped areas)
✅ **Clean edges** (walkways, driveways, flower beds defined)
✅ **All debris blown clear** (hard surfaces spotless)
✅ **No damage** to sprinklers, decorations, plants
✅ **Customer signature** obtained

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Scalped grass (cut too short = brown patches)
- ❌ Missed strips (uneven mowing)
- ❌ Clippings left on driveway/walkway
- ❌ Damaged sprinklers, plants, landscaping

---

### Common Issues

**Issue: Grass is too tall (customer hasn't mowed in weeks)**
- **Solution:** Mow twice. First pass at highest deck setting, second pass at normal height. Bag first pass clippings (too much to mulch). Charge extra if significantly over-quoted scope.

**Issue: Mower won't start**
- **Solution:** Check: fuel, oil, spark plug, air filter. If can't fix quickly, contact UpTend for backup Pro assignment.

**Issue: Hit sprinkler head with mower**
- **Solution:** IMMEDIATELY stop, report in app with photo. Offer to pay for repair or have UpTend coordinate with sprinkler company. DO NOT hide damage (customer will notice).

**Issue: Customer wants stripes (professional mowing pattern)**
- **Solution:** Use striping kit OR mow in alternating directions each pass. Creates light/dark stripe effect (grass blades bent in different directions).

---

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Pre-Service Assessment (5 min)**
1. Mark "Arrived" in app
2. Walk home with customer, assess:
   - Total sqft to clean
   - Carpet type (nylon, polyester, wool)
   - Stains visible (wine, pet, grease, etc.)
   - Furniture moved? (if not, discuss add-on)
   - Customer expectations (how clean do they expect?)
3. Take "BEFORE" photos (6+ angles):
   - Full room shots
   - Close-ups of stains
   - High-traffic areas (hallways, entryways)

**Step 2: Furniture Moving (If Customer Paid Add-On) (10-15 min)**
1. Move light furniture (chairs, end tables, lamps)
2. Place furniture pads under legs (prevents rust stains on damp carpet)
3. **DO NOT move:** Heavy furniture (sofas, beds, dressers) without customer helping OR without "furniture moving" service booked

**Step 3: Pre-Vacuum (10-15 min)**
1. Vacuum ALL carpet areas thoroughly
   - Remove dry soil, dust, pet hair
   - Pre-vacuuming prevents mud formation during wet cleaning
2. Use crevice tool for edges, corners
3. Empty vacuum bag/canister when full

**Step 4: Pre-Treatment (10 min)**
1. Apply pre-treatment spray to:
   - **High-traffic areas** (hallways, entryways, in front of sofas)
   - **Visible stains** (wine, coffee, pet, grease)
2. Let dwell 5-10 minutes (breaks down soil, stains)
3. Agitate with carpet brush (scrub stains gently)

**Stain-Specific Treatments:**
- **Red wine, coffee:** Acidic cleaner
- **Pet urine:** Enzyme cleaner (breaks down uric acid crystals)
- **Grease, oil:** Solvent-based cleaner
- **Ink, marker:** Rubbing alcohol (test in hidden area first)

**Step 5: Hot Water Extraction (30-60 min)**

**HWE Method (Most Common):**
1. Fill machine tank with hot water (140-150°F) + carpet shampoo
2. Start in farthest corner, work toward exit
3. **Cleaning Strokes:**
   - Push wand forward (sprays water + chemical)
   - Pull backward SLOWLY (extracts dirty water)
   - Overlap strokes by 2-3 inches
4. Use upholstery attachment for stairs, edges
5. **Don't over-wet carpet** (too much water = mold risk, long drying time)
   - Goal: Leave carpet damp, not soaking

**Low-Moisture Method (Alternative for Quick-Dry Needs):**
1. Apply encapsulation cleaner (spray or bonnet)
2. Agitate with rotary machine
3. Cleaner crystallizes around dirt particles
4. Vacuum up crystals after drying (30-60 min)
5. **Benefits:** Faster drying (1-2 hours vs. 4-6 hours)

**Step 6: Spot Treatment (As Needed)**

If stains persist after extraction:
1. Reapply stain-specific cleaner
2. Agitate with brush
3. Blot with microfiber cloth (don't rub = spreads stain)
4. Extract again with wand

**Expectation Setting:** Some stains are permanent (old pet urine, bleach spots, dye transfer). Communicate early: "This stain is very old. I'll do my best, but it may not come out completely."

**Step 7: Carpet Grooming (5 min)**
1. Use carpet rake to:
   - Lift carpet fibers (stand upright)
   - Distribute moisture evenly
   - Speed drying
2. Rake in direction of room exit (all fibers face one way)

**Step 8: Set Up Air Movers (5 min)**
1. Place 3+ air movers around room
2. Aim at wet carpet (not walls, furniture)
3. Turn on high speed
4. Leave running for 4-6 hours (customer can turn off after)

**Step 9: Protectant Application (Optional Upsell)**

If customer paid for protectant:
1. Spray Scotchgard or similar on all carpet
2. Creates stain-resistant barrier
3. Extends carpet life by 30%

**Step 10: Final Inspection & Customer Communication (5 min)**
1. Take "AFTER" photos (same angles as "BEFORE")
2. Walk home with customer:
   - Point out transformation (especially stain removal)
   - Explain drying process: "Carpets should be dry in 4-6 hours. Avoid walking if possible. You can speed it up by running AC."
3. Care instructions:
   - "Wait 24 hours before replacing furniture"
   - "Vacuum regularly to maintain cleanliness"
   - "Annual DeepFiber cleaning recommended to extend carpet life"
4. Get customer signature in app

**Step 11: Cleanup & Documentation (5 min)**
1. Pack all equipment
2. Empty dirty water tank (outside drain or toilet)
3. Rinse all tanks, hoses
4. Mark "Job Complete" in app
5. App calculates:
   - Cleanliness score: Before 3/10 → After 9/10 (AI)
   - Carpet life extension: +2 years (from proper cleaning)
   - Water efficiency: HWE 0.15 gal/sqft vs. standard 0.30 gal/sqft

---

### Quality Standards

✅ **Carpet visibly cleaner** (stains removed or significantly reduced)
✅ **No overwetting** (carpet damp, not soaking)
✅ **Air movers placed** (speeds drying)
✅ **No chemical residue** (fully rinsed)
✅ **Customer signature** obtained

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Carpet still soaking wet after 1 hour (over-wetted)
- ❌ Stains not treated properly
- ❌ Carpet smells worse after cleaning (chemicals not rinsed, mildew forming)
- ❌ Carpet discolored (wrong chemicals used)

---

### Common Issues

**Issue: Stains won't come out**
- **Solution:** Some stains are permanent (old pet urine, bleach, dye). Set expectations early: "I'll do my best, but this may be permanent." Document with photos.

**Issue: Carpet still smells (pet odor)**
- **Solution:** Pet urine soaked into padding/subfloor. Surface cleaning won't fix it. Recommend: "You may need subfloor treatment or padding replacement. That's beyond carpet cleaning."

**Issue: Customer wants carpet dry immediately**
- **Solution:** Use low-moisture method (if you have equipment). HWE requires 4-6 hours drying. Can't be rushed without damaging carpet.

**Issue: Color bleed (red stains appearing after cleaning)**
- **Solution:** This is "wicking" (stain from padding rising to surface). Re-clean affected areas, extract more water. May take 2-3 cleanings to fully remove.

---

### Pro Tips for Maximum Earnings

💰 **Upsell Protectant:** $50-75 per room, 5 minutes of work = high margin.
💰 **Annual Plans:** Annual DeepFiber = $199/year per customer. Sign up 30 customers = $5,970/year guaranteed income.

**Step 4: Loading Truck (60-90 min)**

**Loading Order:**
1. **Heavy items first** (appliances, dressers, bookcases) → toward cab
2. **Mattresses/box springs** → stand upright against walls (saves space)
3. **Sofas, chairs** → load on side, nest inside each other if possible
4. **Boxes** → stack heaviest on bottom, lightest on top
   - Label: "This side up," "Fragile," "Kitchen," etc.
5. **Loose items last** (lamps, plants, bags)

**Loading Tips:**
- **Tier system:** Load floor, then build upward (like Tetris)
- **Fill gaps** (no shifting during transport)
- **Use straps** (secure stacks, prevent toppling)

**Step 5: Transport (Customer Drives OR You Drive if Booked)**

4. Take photo of wiring (so you know how to reconnect)
5. Loosen terminal screws, disconnect wires

**Step 3: Install New Outlet/Switch (10 min)**
1. Match wire colors:
   - **Black** = hot (goes to brass/gold screw)
   - **White** = neutral (goes to silver screw)
   - **Green/Bare Copper** = ground (goes to green screw)
2. Bend wire ends into hook shape (clockwise, so tightening screw closes the loop)
3. Attach wires to new outlet/switch (match your photo)
4. Tighten terminal screws (snug, not over-tight)
5. Push outlet/switch back into box (tuck wires neatly)
6. Screw outlet/switch to box
7. Attach cover plate

**Step 4: Test (5 min)**
1. Remove tape from breaker
2. Turn breaker back on
3. Test outlet with tester (should show power)
4. Plug in lamp or phone charger (verify it works)

**Step 5: Documentation (2 min)**
1. Take "AFTER" photo
2. Get customer signature

**Common Issues:**
- **Issue:** Three wires (2 blacks + white + ground)
  - **Solution:** This is a switch loop or 3-way switch. Take clear photo, consult wiring diagram, or decline job if unsure (better safe than sorry).
- **Issue:** Aluminum wiring (silver-colored, not copper)
  - **Solution:** STOP. Aluminum wiring requires special handling and anti-oxidant paste. Recommend licensed electrician.
- **Issue:** Outlet still doesn't work after replacement
  - **Solution:** Issue may be upstream (tripped GFCI, bad wire connection in box, breaker issue). Troubleshoot or recommend electrician.

### Quality Standards

✅ **Task completed per customer request**
✅ **No damage** to walls, floors, furniture, fixtures
✅ **Clean finish** (no visible screws, patching smooth, caulk neat)
✅ **Functional test passed** (TV works, drawer slides, faucet doesn't leak, outlet has power)
✅ **Customer signature** obtained

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Task incomplete (TV not level, drawer sticking, leak not fixed)
- ❌ Damage caused during work (scratched wall, broken fixture)
- ❌ Unsafe work (TV not anchored to studs, electrical work with power on)
- ❌ Sloppy finish (visible patch, uneven caulk)

---

### Common Issues (General)

**Issue: Customer adds tasks mid-job**
- **Solution:** "I can definitely do that. Let me add it to the job in the app so you're charged correctly." Use app to add tasks with pricing.

**Issue: Don't have the right tool**
- **Solution:** "I need [specific tool] to complete this safely. I can run to Home Depot (15 min), or we can reschedule." Most customers will wait for small items.

**Issue: Job more complex than expected (hidden damage, etc.)**
- **Solution:** Take photos, show customer, explain: "This is more involved than the original scope. I can complete it for $X additional, or I can recommend a specialist."

**Issue: Customer wants you to do something you're not licensed for (gas line, major electrical)**
- **Solution:** "That requires a licensed [plumber/electrician] in Florida. I'm not able to do that work, but I can recommend a trusted pro."

### Pro Tips for Maximum Earnings

💰 **Multi-Task Bundling:** Customer books TV mount. While there, ask: "Anything else you need done while I'm here? Shelf install, picture hanging?" Upsell 2-3 small tasks = $300+ total job.
💰 **Recurring Customers:** FixIt customers often have ongoing small projects. Offer your contact: "Save my number. Next time you have a honey-do list, text me directly."
💰 **10% Multi-Task Discount:** If customer books 3+ tasks, they save 10% (built into pricing). Encourage bundling: "If you add one more task, you'll hit the 3-task discount and save $X."
💰 **Upsell Materials:** Customer didn't buy paint for drywall patch. Offer: "I can grab paint for you and color-match it. Adds $25." (You buy $10 sample can, charge $25 = $15 profit).
💰 **Referrals:** FixIt customers are often homeowners with friends/family who need help. Ask: "Do any of your neighbors need handyman work? I offer $15 referral credit for every new customer."

# Appendix C: Customer Communication Scripts

## Arrival Greeting
> "Hi, I'm [Name] with UpTend here for your [service]. This will take about [X minutes]. Let me walk the property with you so I understand exactly what you need."

## Explaining DwellScan
> "DwellScan creates a complete record of your property's condition — like a Carfax for your home. I'll be documenting every room and appliance. This data builds your Property Health Score, helps with insurance claims, warranty claims, and even increases your home's resale value because buyers see a complete maintenance history. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes."

## Handling Objections ("That's expensive")
> "I get it. But think about it this way: [DwellScan / GutterFlush / etc.] prevents way more expensive problems down the road. A clogged gutter causes foundation damage = $8,000 repair. Our $129 service prevents that. Plus, you get $49 credit toward your next UpTend service, so it's really only $X out of pocket."

## Upselling
> "While I'm here, I noticed [issue]. I can take care of that for [price] if you'd like. Saves you from booking another visit later."

## Asking for Recurring Service
> "Most customers love setting up a recurring schedule so they never have to think about it. [Service] every [frequency] keeps [benefit]. Want me to set that up for you today?"

## Post-Job Thank You
> "All done! Everything looks great. You should get your [Property Health Score / invoice / report] within 24 hours. If you have any questions, just message me through the UpTend app. Have a great day!"
