- Footer: complete with hello@uptendapp.com, (407) 338-3342, FB/IG/TikTok, all legal links.
- **Issues**: Nav shows "TP Test" and "Log out" (logged-in test user visible). Spanish toggle "¿Español? Cambiar →" is present but unclear if it works. "11 Services" heading — count is correct but Home DNA Scan makes it 12 total offerings.

## 2. INVESTOR DEALBREAKERS

1. **BROKEN MAP MARKERS on /find-pro** — The map shows broken image icons instead of pins. This is the most visible page for showing "we have real pros." If an investor sees this during a demo, it signals technical debt. **MUST FIX BEFORE ANY DEMO.**

2. **Test user visible in nav** — "TP Test" and "Log out" show in the navigation bar across ALL pages. Any logged-in demo session shows internal test data. Need a clean demo mode or log out before any presentation.

3. **Pre-filled test credentials on login pages** — capntest@uptend.app is auto-filled on both login pages. Browser autofill issue but looks unprofessional in a demo.

---

## 3. CUSTOMER DEALBREAKERS

1. **Broken map on Find a Pro** — A customer looking for local pros sees broken images on the map. This destroys trust immediately. They'd leave and go to Angi or Thumbtack.

2. **No visible customer reviews on Find a Pro page** — While pros show review counts (30, 38, 95 reviews), there's no way to read actual reviews on the pro cards. Customer wants to read reviews before booking.

3. **/book page is too sparse** — Customer clicks "Book a Service" and gets a single address input with a massive footer. No reassurance, no service selection, no "what happens next." This is a conversion killer.

---

## 4. WHAT'S EXCELLENT (Pitch Highlights)

1. **Pricing transparency** — The pricing page is best-in-class for home services. Every service has clear tiers, features listed, and "Book Now" CTAs. The liability protection section adds serious credibility.

2. **Founder story on /about** — Alan's personal narrative about the broken system is authentic and compelling. Investors love founder-problem-fit. This page alone could close interest.

3. **Mr. George AI assistant** — Available on every page, 140 tools, 13 capabilities. The meet-george page is a showpiece. This is the tech moat.

4. **Home DNA Scan product** — Unique in the market. $99/$249 pricing with clear value prop. The comparison to CarFax for homes is sticky.

5. **Pro value proposition** — "Keep 80% of every job, zero lead fees, 48hr payouts" — this solves real pro pain points that Angi/Thumbtack don't.

6. **Blog + Cost Guides** — Strong content marketing foundation. Gradient thumbnails look professional. Cost guides are SEO gold.

7. **Emergency page** — Smart addition. 30-min response time claim with 911 disclaimer shows responsibility.

8. **Sustainability angle** — ESG credentials, landfill diversion tracking, carbon impact. This differentiates from every competitor and appeals to property managers.

9. **Dual marketplace design** — The landing page speaks to BOTH homeowners and pros simultaneously. "Fair for customers. Fair for Pros. That's the whole point." is a rare positioning win.

10. **5 real-sounding testimonials** — Named, located in specific Orlando neighborhoods. Reads authentic.

## 5. IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED (Priority Order)

### P0 — Fix Before Any Demo
1. **Fix broken map markers on /find-pro** — Map pin images are 404ing. Check the marker icon asset path. This is likely a missing `/marker-icon.png` or similar Leaflet default icon issue.

2. **Log out test user / hide auth state** — Remove "TP Test" and "Log out" from nav for demos. Either log out or implement a demo mode that hides auth UI.

3. **Clear autofill on login pages** — Add `autocomplete="off"` or use fresh browser profile for demos.

### P1 — Fix This Week
4. **Add content to /book page** — Include service selection cards, a "How it works" mini-flow, or at least "Select a service to get started" with service icons. Current page is a conversion dead end.

5. **Add footer to /find-pro page** — Only page missing the footer.

6. **Fix /academy page styling** — Bring it in line with the dark theme. Add a hero section. Currently looks like a different website.

### P2 — Fix Before Launch
7. **Verify all map markers work on landing page too** — Landing page map showed "Marker" buttons in accessibility tree, which may indicate the same broken icon issue (just less visible on the dark map background).

8. **Add review snippets to pro cards on /find-pro** — Show 1-2 actual review quotes on each pro card, not just counts.

9. **Spanish language toggle** — The "¿Español? Cambiar →" link is on the landing page but unclear if the full site translates. Either make it work or remove it.

---

## 6. OVERALL INVESTOR READINESS: 7.5/10

**The Good**: The site tells a compelling story. Founder narrative, clear problem/solution, unique product (Home DNA Scan), strong AI differentiation (Mr. George), and a dual marketplace that serves both sides. The pricing page is best-in-class. The about page would make an investor lean forward.

**The Concern**: The broken map markers on /find-pro are the single biggest issue — it's the page that proves you have supply (pros). A savvy investor will navigate there immediately. The test user in the nav bar signals "this is still a prototype." The sparse /book page suggests the conversion funnel isn't fully built.

**With the P0 fixes (2-3 hours of work)**: This jumps to **8.5/10** — genuinely impressive for a pre-Series A startup. The content depth, AI integration, and sustainability positioning are all ahead of market.

---

## 7. OVERALL CUSTOMER READINESS: 7/10

**The Good**: A customer landing on the homepage would be impressed. Clear pricing, trust badges, real testimonials, and the AI assistant is genuinely useful. The emergency page handles urgent needs well. Blog and cost guides build authority.

**The Concern**: The booking flow needs work — /book is too bare. Find a Pro has broken maps. There's no way to read actual reviews. A customer comparing UpTend to Angi would find Angi has more reviews and a smoother booking flow.

**With fixes**: This could reach **8.5/10** — the transparency, guaranteed pricing, and AI assistant are genuine differentiators that no competitor has.
