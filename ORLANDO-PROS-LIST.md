## Notes
- Craigslist Orlando has active handyman/pressure washing/cleaning posts but individual posters rarely include permanent contact info (phone anonymized through CL relay)
- Thumbtack pros don't publicly list phone/email — must contact through platform
- Florida Sunbiz search requires interactive form submission (not scriptable via web_fetch)
- Facebook business pages often hide contact info behind login walls
- For Thumbtack pros, the best approach is to find them cross-referenced on Google/Yelp for direct contact
