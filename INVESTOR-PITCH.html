<h2 id="the-600-billion-problem-nobody-has-solved">The $600 Billion
Problem Nobody Has Solved</h2>
<p>The home services industry generates <strong>$600 billion
annually</strong> in the United States. Every HOA, every property
management company, every general contractor, every government agency —
they all need vendors. Thousands of them. Every single day.</p>
<p>And they’re still managing it with <strong>phone calls, spreadsheets,
and prayer.</strong></p>
<p>Thumbtack connects consumers to handymen. ServiceTitan sells software
to plumbers. Nobody — <strong>absolutely nobody</strong> — has built the
operating system that institutional buyers actually need:
compliance-grade vendor management with real-time dispatch, government
contract automation, and a vetted workforce at scale.</p>
<p><strong>UpTend has. And it’s already live.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-we-built-while-everyone-else-was-talking">What We Built
(While Everyone Else Was Talking)</h2>
<p><strong>110+ production features.</strong> Not wireframes. Not pitch
decks. Not “coming soon.” <strong>Live. Deployed. Demoable right
now.</strong></p>
<p>🤖 <strong>13 AI capabilities</strong> — real Claude AI powering
instant estimates, photo quotes, document scanning, route optimization,
and George, our AI concierge that guides every interaction.</p>
<p>🏛️ <strong>Full government contract suite</strong> — Davis-Bacon
prevailing wage automation, WH-347 certified payroll generation, SAM.gov
integration, DBE/SDVOSB utilization tracking, FEMA rapid response
activation. No home services company on Earth has this.</p>
<p>🏘️ <strong>HOA &amp; Property Management OS</strong> —
multi-community dashboards, board approval workflows, tenant work
orders, make-ready turnover automation, SLA management. One PM company
sale = hundreds of units = recurring revenue for years.</p>
<p>🏗️ <strong>Construction sub management</strong> — punch lists, lien
waiver automation, permit tracking, safety compliance. GCs are begging
for this.</p>
<p>🎖️ <strong>America’s veteran workforce platform</strong> — DD-214
verification, MOS-to-trade mapping, SDVOSB certification tracking,
disabled veteran accommodations, military spouse program. 200,000
service members transition annually. We catch them.</p>
<p>💳 <strong>Stripe payments, real-time WebSocket tracking, email
notifications, review system, ESG impact scoring</strong> — the full
stack, production-hardened, deployed on Railway.</p>

<h2 id="why-now">Why NOW</h2>
<p><strong>Florida is ground zero.</strong> 40M+ tourists, explosive
population growth, hurricane-driven demand spikes, and the largest
concentration of HOAs in America. We’re launching in Orlando Metro — the
perfect proving ground — then expanding statewide, then nationally.</p>
<p><strong>The veteran angle is a strategic weapon.</strong> Our
SDVOSB-certified subsidiary (51% minority veteran-owned) unlocks federal
sole-source contracts up to $5M with <strong>zero competition</strong>.
State and local contracts give preference points for veteran labor.
Every veteran we recruit is simultaneously a skilled worker AND a
compliance asset.</p>
<p><strong>AI is our moat.</strong> While competitors bolt chatbots onto
legacy platforms, we built AI into the foundation. George doesn’t just
answer questions — he quotes jobs, books services, optimizes schedules,
and manages the entire customer relationship. Our 13 AI capabilities
aren’t features. They’re the product.</p>

<p>We’re not competing. We’re creating a category.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-flywheel-that-prints-money">The Flywheel That Prints
Money</h2>
<pre><code>More B2B contracts → More job volume → More veteran recruitment
       ↑                                         ↓
Higher retention ← Stable pro income ← Government set-asides
       ↑                                         ↓
More investors ← Proven recurring revenue ← More contracts won</code></pre>
<p>Every B2B client we sign generates recurring revenue that funds more
veteran recruitment, which unlocks more government contracts, which
attracts more institutional buyers. <strong>This flywheel doesn’t slow
down. It accelerates.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-100k-gets-you">What $100K Gets You</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>10% equity</strong> at a $1M cap (pre-revenue SAFE)</li>
<li>Ground floor of the <strong>only platform</strong> that serves
institutional home services buyers</li>
<li>Exposure to <strong>$4B+ in federal set-aside contracts</strong>
through our SDVOSB certification</li>
<li>A founding team that doesn’t just plan — <strong>we ship.</strong>
110+ features, live site, deployed in weeks, not years</li>
<li>First-mover advantage in a $600B market where the incumbents are
asleep</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>You’re not investing in an idea. You’re investing in a <strong>live,
deployed, 110-feature platform</strong> with a clear path to revenue
through the most underserved, highest-value segment of home services:
institutional buyers who write six-figure annual contracts.</p>
<p>The technology is built. The veteran pipeline is ready. The
government contracts are waiting. The only question is whether you want
to be on the cap table when this thing takes off — or watching from the
sidelines wishing you’d moved faster.</p>
<p><strong>UpTend. Built Different. Built to Win.</strong></p>
